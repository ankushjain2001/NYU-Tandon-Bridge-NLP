# NYU Tandon Bridge - NLP

The NYU Tandon Bridge program is designed for students from non-technical backgrounds who are interested in pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. The program curriculum is designed such that the students can gain prerequisite knowledge required for pursuing the degree.

In this work, we utilized data science tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, and neural networks to analyze the various data artifacts generated from the course. 

- Topic Modelling of course modules
- Visualizing the correlations between the course modules
- Sentiment analysis of forum discussion data
- Data pipeline to scrape data from Piazza
- Data pipeline to pre-process raw SRT transcripts, PPTs, PDFs, and Piazza API data
