1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,080
Okay, so now that we know how to work with
other number systems, we know how to a convert

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,189
from one system to another.

3
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:13,599
Let's see how we can do some math; how we
can do some arithmetic in different number

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,599
systems.

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,590
Let's start with addition: how we can add
numbers to one another.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,860
So again, let's start with a decimal number
system.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,340
And make sure we get exactly what we do there,
and then, try to generalize it to other number

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,340
systems as well.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:35,030
So, for example, let's try to add 325 to 692,
two decimal numbers.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,409
We start, I think third grade, our teacher
said start with the ones digit.

11
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:44,059
So, we add 5 and 2, we get 7.

12
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:50,520
And then, for the tens digit we had 2 tens
and 9 tens, that would give us 11 tens, which

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,989
would, 11 tens would be grouped into 100 and
an additional ten.

14
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:04,930
That's why we write 1 in the tens, and carry
over an additional hundred.

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:13,500
Then we have 100 plus 300 plus 600, it adds
up to 10 hundreds.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,900
And we have, therefore, 0 for the ten hundreds
and 1 for the thousand because these 10 hundreds

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,680
were grouped into one group of a thousand.

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,390
So, we have 0 hundreds and 1 carried to the
thousands, which would then be dropped down,

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,250
and all together we have 1017.

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:41,080
Let's try to do the same when we add, or we
try to do some additions, in the Octal number

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
system.

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,600
For example, a 365 plus 243 Octal.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,090
Again, we start with the ones digit, 5 plus
3.

24
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,409
When we add 5 plus 3, we get 8.

25
00:01:53,409 --> 00:02:00,200
But we don't just write 8, because in the
octal number system, 8 ones are grouped into

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,560
a single ten.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:10,369
So, after grouping these eight ones to a ten,
we have 0 additional ones and a carry over

28
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:12,230
of a ten.

29
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:22,860
Then, we add a 10, another 6 ten and another
4 ten, that would give us 11 tens, right?

30
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,010
Maybe let's try to count it; count it up starting
at 6.

31
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,790
So, we kind of have to add: 6 plus 5.

32
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,260
So, let's add 5 to 6.

33
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,379
Letâ€™s count.

34
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:43,230
After six comes seven, after seven we have
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, so we have

35
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,540
thirteen in the tens position.

36
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:54,140
So, we group ten of them to hundreds, we are
left with 3 tens and one hundred is carry

37
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,140
over.

38
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:02,110
Then, we have 3 plus 1 that's a 4, plus 2
that's a five, a six, that would give us 6.

39
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:10,340
So all together, 365 octal plus 243 octal,
gives us 630 octal, right?

40
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,000
Same thing as we've done with the decimal,
we are working in the octal.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,920
We just keep in mind to group items when we
have eight individual ones.

42
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,760
Same thing would work when we try to add binary
numbers: 0 plus 1 would be a 1, 0 plus 0 would

43
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,260
give us 0, 1 plus 0 would be 1, 1 plus 1 that
is 2 obviously.

44
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,620
That would be 0 plus 1 of a carry over, 1
plus 1 plus 1, that's a 3, that would leave

45
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,220
1 plus 1 of a carry over.

46
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:55,630
1 plus 0 plus 0 would be a1, 0 plus 1 is 1,
and 1 plus 1 is basically 2, or 10.

47
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,800
Or a 0 plus a 1 carry over, which then drops
down.

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,290
And that is the result of adding these two
binary numbers.

49
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,620
Try a few on your own, and make sure you get
how to add the numbers in terms of alternative

50
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,510
number system.
