1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,390
The same thing would work when we are counting
in other number systems as well.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,800
I'll talk about some of the more important
ones.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,190
One of them is the octal number system, short
for base eight.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,071
The digits here would be zero to seven; we're
going to group eight objects together, so

5
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:21,940
we need symbols zero up to seven.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,730
It would start zero, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:33,320
After this seven, we would have one group
of octal ten and zero ones, eleven, twelve,

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,140
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,930
After seventeen, the next one would be grouped
into another ten.

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,890
So we would have two tens, zero ones and so
on.

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,920
Again, try to think what comes before a hundred.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,079
Hope you got it right, it's 77 right?

13
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,399
After 77, the next object would be grouped
into another ten, the next eight tens would

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,100
be grouped into one single object of 100 or
100 things.
