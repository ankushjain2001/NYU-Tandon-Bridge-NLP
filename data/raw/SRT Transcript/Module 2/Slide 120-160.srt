1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:06,790
So, for that let's start with the decimal
number system itself; understand exactly what

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,910
the positions of each digit mean, and then
try to generalize it to other number systems

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,910
as well.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,500
So, for example, number 375, decimal 375.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,090
So, we have three digits here: the ones, tens,
and hundreds.

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,540
So, the one basically stands for the five,
that is in the one's position.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,610
Each value here, represents a single object,
right?

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:37,660
Each value in the tens position represents
a group of ten objects, and each value in

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,680
the hundreds position represents a group of
one hundred objects.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,910
We like to write it as powers of ten, so one
hundred is ten to the power of two, ten is

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,640
ten to the power of one, and one is ten to
the power of zero.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:01:00,800
So, now we can look at 375 as a weighted sum
of these weights of the digits in their position.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,790
So, we have five times one object: ten to
the power of zero.

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,330
Plus seven tens: seven times ten to the power
of one.

15
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,320
Plus three hundred, which is three times ten
to the power of two.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,140
If you add that, you get to 375, not surprising
at all, but that what we mean when we say

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,650
375 decimal.

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,260
Now, let's look at 125 octal, for example.

19
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,900
Once again, each digit here has its own weight,
its own amount of objects that it represents.

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,380
So, the ones digits represent a single object
here as well.

21
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,210
The ten digits represent a group of eight,
right?

22
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:49,710
And the hundredth digits represent eight eighths
or eight octal tens, which means 64 objects.

23
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,530
Once again, let's write it as powers of eight.

24
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,620
So, sixty four is eight to the power of two,
eight is eight to the power of one, and one

25
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,200
is eight to the power of zero.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:09,069
So, 125 octal, we can look at it as the sum
of: 5 times 1 times 8 to the power of 0, plus

27
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:13,159
2 times 8 to the power of 1, plus 1 times
8 to the power of 2.

28
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,000
If you add them all up, you get 85.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,939
Basically, 125 octal represents an amount
of 85 objects, decimal eighty five by the

30
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,319
way.

31
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,659
Same thing would work with the binary number
system.

32
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:32,400
So, again each digit has its own weight, right?

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,120
The ones digit is 1, the tens digit is 2,
the hundreds digit is 4 and the fourth digit,

34
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,459
the thousandth digit, represents an amount
of eight.

35
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:47,799
Again, as powers of 2 to the 0, 2 to the 1,
2 to the 2, and 2 to the 3.

36
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:53,299
And the sum would then be 1 times 2 to the
zero, plus 1 times 2 to the 1, plus 0 times

37
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:57,459
2 squared, and 1 times 2 to the three.

38
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,459
You add them, you'll get eleven.

39
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:07,599
So, 1011 binary is equivalent, represents,
11 objects, 11 decimal, right?

40
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,169
Same thing for hexadecimal 3b2.

41
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:17,139
Each digit has its own weight: 16 to the 0,
16 to the 1, 16 to the 2, and then when you

42
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:23,129
add it up, you get 2 times 16 to the 0, 11
times 16 to the 1, right?

43
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,339
B. is one after the A: A is ten, B. is eleven.

44
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:31,219
So, 11 times 6 into the 1 to 3 times 16 squared.

45
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:34,239
All together it adds up to 946.

46
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:42,349
If you look in a general form, you look at
the number An to a 0, like you have n. plus

47
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:43,419
1 digits here.

48
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:49,820
In the number system, base B., each digit
would have its own weight: b. to the 0, b.

49
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,150
to the power of 1, b. to the power of 2, up
to b. to the power of N. And this number,

50
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:02,790
if you add the digits with their corresponding
weight, you'll have the formula: A0 times

51
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,969
B. to the power of 0, plus A1 times b to the
power of 1, and so on up to An times B. to

52
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:08,969
the power of N.

53
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:14,409
If you use this technique, you'll be able
to figure out whatâ€™s the decimal value that

54
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,350
is represented, in this case a base B. number.
