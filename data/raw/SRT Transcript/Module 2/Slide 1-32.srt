00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,610
Hi there, hoping you're having a great day.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,760
Today we're going to talk about position and
number systems, and we're all used to working

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,470
with the decimal number system.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,970
We're going to see some other number systems
today and see how we can generalize the way

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,340
we work with a decimal number system to work
with some other kinds of number systems.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,400
But before we do that, let's talk, let's say
a few words about a memory of a presentation.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:35,260
So we know that our memory basically is made
out of bits that are grouped into a bytes,

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:43,980
each one of these bits physically is made
with electricity flow or a magnetic field.

9
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,019
But we like to think of it abstractly as zero
and one because it only has two states.

10
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:59,640
We would need to figure out how to represent
a lot of data using only this kind of a primitive

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
unit.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,940
So we can think that for example numbers can
be represented using the binary number system,

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,640
we'll talk about it in much more detail soon.

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,050
But the idea is to represent not only numbers,
but other kinds of data is as well.

15
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,960
For example text, if we write a document or
an email.

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,690
How is that represented using zeros and ones
and not symbols as the alphabet symbols?

17
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:33,680
Images; how do were present images with all
the colors and details with the zeros and

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
ones?

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,730
How do we represent videos, or how do we represent
audio?

20
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,960
All of that should be represented using only
zeros and ones.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,680
So the key idea here is that everything would
be represented as a number, and in a few minutes

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,850
we see how we represent numbers, but first
let's see that all kinds of data can be transformed

23
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,040
into numbers, for example text.

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,760
We have a mapping for each letter, for each
symbol in our alphabet into a number.

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:11,670
So if we want to take the text, for example
“Hello world!” we can use this mapping.

26
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,170
For example, the upper case “H” would
be 72.

27
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:25,090
So we start with 72 and then the lowercase,
“e” is 101, so we have 101, and then lowercase

28
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,379
“l” is 108.

29
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:30,799
So we have two 108’s and so on.

30
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:37,519
Every character has its own mapped number,
and we have a sequence of numbers to represent

31
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,639
basically a text or a sentence.

32
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,700
Not only letters, but also a symbol, such
as space or a question mark.

33
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:54,010
Every symbol has its own a number that its
mapped to, so text also is mapped into numbers.

34
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,329
Images are a bit more tricky.

35
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:59,840
Let's say we have a beautiful image that we
want to represent with numbers.

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,090
So you know that images is a very dense matrix
of pixels: each small pixel has its own unique

37
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,040
color and then a color can also be represented
using numbers.

38
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,099
To represent a color, a common way to do that
is using an R.G.B., a representation basically

39
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,779
the amount of red, green, and blue.

40
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:26,359
Each one ranges 0 to 255.

41
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:36,230
So for example, this purple here is 120 red,
100 green, and 200 blue.

42
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,299
The Pink has other values of R G. and B. and
so on.

43
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:47,150
So basically, each pixel has three numbers
that represent its color and then the entire

44
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:55,510
picture would be a very, very long sequence
of numbers that represent the level of each

45
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,049
color.

46
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,010
Videos are basically a sequence of images,
so if we know how to represent images with

47
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,129
numbers, obviously we can represent videos
with numbers.

48
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:08,709
Audio also can be represented with numbers.

49
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:18,630
If we sample the audio wave at a very high
rate of times, we can see the voltage level

50
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,510
in each point of time that is also a number.

51
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:28,160
So basically, all our data is first transformed
into numbers.

52
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,810
Numbers can be represented with the zeros
and ones, we see that in a few minutes.

53
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,880
And therefore, all our data in our memory
is then represented with the zeros and ones.

54
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,201
Let's go ahead and see how we can represent
numbers with zeros and ones.
