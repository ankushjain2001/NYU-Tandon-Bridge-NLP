1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,190
Okay, let's do another example working with
Two’s Complement.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:12,580
So let's take this number here, 00101101,
represented in a 2-bit Two’s Complement,

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:18,540
that's the representation method for this
number, and try to figure out what's its decimal

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,190
equivalent, what this number basically represents.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:29,210
So, since it a starts with a zero, we know
that it is a positive number.

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,410
Then, this representation method says that
the first (k minus 1), seven bits, basically

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,010
represent its value.

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:48,450
So if we add 32 and 8 and 4 and 1, we get
45 and this number is basically the decimal

9
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,550
45.

10
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,579
Let's take a look at this number here, 11101010,
again in an 8-bit Two’s Complement representation

11
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,329
and try to figure out what its decimal representation.

12
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,390
In this case, since it starts with the one,
it's not a positive number.

13
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,890
But this a presentation method is not ‘Sign
and Magnitude’ that we can just figure out

14
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:16,760
the value of the lower seven bits and say
that it is negative of this value.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,420
Since it's a Two’s Complement representation
method, we should figure out the absolute

16
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,790
value of this number in a different way.

17
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,880
So let's use the second property that the
sum of a number and its additive value, additive

18
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,110
inverse, is 2 to the power of 8.

19
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:43,670
In this case, we know that, we don't know
what these values are but we know that this

20
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,310
number here is some kind of a negative something.

21
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,200
Let’s say negative X.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:57,710
So 11101010 is some negative X. and we’ll
try to find what positive X. is, so we can

23
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,820
know what the absolute value of this number.

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,950
So once again, we're trying to figure out
what number is missing there, to be the additive

25
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,970
inverse of the number that we have no idea
what it is.

26
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,389
But since the additive inverse would be positive
and positive numbers are much easier to figure

27
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:18,090
out their value, we can then figure out what
the value of the negative number.

28
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:27,599
So once again, let's try to find what's the
additive inverse of our input of this 11101010.

29
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,611
So 0 plus what, would give us a zero?

30
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,611
0 plus 0.

31
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,169
1 plus what, would give us a zero?

32
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,840
Plus 1 with a carry over.

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,129
1 plus 0 plus 1, and then another carry over.

34
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:44,430
1 plus 1 plus 0 with the carry over.

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,370
1 plus 0 plus 1, and 1 plus 1 plus 0.

36
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,269
And 1 plus 0 plus 0, and 1 plus 1 plus 0.

37
00:02:53,269 --> 00:03:04,139
So, basically we got that our number is 11101010
but its additive inverse, its absolute value,

38
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:14,870
it's positive corresponding value is 00010110.

39
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,709
And this number is very easy to figure out
its value because we just have to add the

40
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,109
weights of each digit.

41
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:28,930
So we have a 2 plus a 4 plus 16, and that
adds up to 22.

42
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:35,319
So this number here is positive 22, which
implies that the negative number we had before

43
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,079
is negative 22.

44
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:47,499
So this number 11101010 in an 8-bit Two’s
Complement representation, it represents the

45
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,849
number negative 22 decimal.
