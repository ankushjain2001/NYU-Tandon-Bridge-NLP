1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:06,029
Okay, so now that we know the technique of
how to convert the hexadecimal to binary and

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,630
backwards binary to hexadecimal.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:15,210
Let's try to say a few words justifying why
this magic here works, that we can translate

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:23,570
each digit individually, independently without
caring with its surrounding.

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:29,710
I'll try to give you the intuition of the
argument, basically demonstrating it on a

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,829
specific binary number and how to convert
it into hexadecimal.

7
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:42,069
Hopefully you would be able to take this calculation
here and generalize it into formal proof,

8
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:43,850
general proof for all cases.

9
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:52,569
So, let's look at this binary number and I'll
try to make some mathematical equations, or

10
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:58,519
quantities, that eventually would end up with
the hexadecimal equivalent.

11
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:07,729
But, as we go, you’ll see how we are relating
back to the table and converting each 4 bits

12
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:12,350
independently to its hexadecimal digit.

13
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:19,829
So, let's get started: so we have this number
here, it's a binary number, therefore we can

14
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,070
write it equivalently as a weighted sum of
powers of 2.

15
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:31,500
So, it is 1 times 2 to the 0, plus 1 times
2 to the 1, plus 0 times 2 to the second,

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
and so on.

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,720
We can go up to, I think it goes out to 0
times 0 to the power of, raised to the power

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,770
of 11, and now let's look at this sum here,
with 12 errands.

19
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:51,690
And probably, not really surprisingly, we’ll
divide it into groups of 4 errands.

20
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,450
So, let's start with the first 4.

21
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,460
In this case, let's take the first 4 errands
and just actually copy them.

22
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,520
So, we have 1 times 2 to the 0, plus 1 times
2 to the 1, plus 0 times 2 to the square,

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,539
plus 0 times 2 to the power of 3.

24
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:18,790
So, obviously our first 4 errands in the upper
side are equal to the first 4 in the lower

25
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,700
one.

26
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,950
It won't make any difference if I also multiplied
by one, right?

27
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,090
Or in other words, instead of one I can just
write 2 to the power of 0, exactly the same,

28
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,090
right?

29
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,760
So that's what we do with the first 4 errands,
we kept them equal just wrote it a bit differently.

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,340
Let's take the next 4 errands, in this case,
instead of just copying them as is, we'll

31
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,519
factor them by 2 to the 4.

32
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,400
So, instead of 1 times 2 to the 4, we do 1
times 2 to the 0.

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,950
And later we'll just multiply it by 2 to the
4 and 0 times 2 to the 5 would be 0 times

34
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,209
2 to the 1 and 1 times 2 to the second, and
1 times 2 to the third.

35
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:12,050
So, taking these 4 errands in the parenthesis
and multiplying them by 2 to the 4, would

36
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:19,970
give you the second 4 errands up there.

37
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,390
For the last 4 errands, we’ll do something
very similar.

38
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:29,480
We’ll write them but will factor them in
this case by 2 to the 8.

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
Right.

40
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:39,209
So, the first one would be 0 times 2 to the
0, plus 1 times 2 to the 1, and so on.

41
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:49,689
You can see that each parenthesis here has
some combination of the first 4 powers of

42
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,840
2.

43
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,049
Let's take a look at these ones for starters.

44
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:04,390
Let's go back to the table and if we take
a look here, at this line here, this number

45
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:11,980
0011 actually equals to 1 times 2 to the 0,
plus 1 times 2 to the 1, plus 0 times 2 to

46
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,879
the second, plus 0 times 2 to the 3, which
is equivalent to 3.

47
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:19,900
So, this thing here is equal to 3, same thing.

48
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:26,110
So, we can write it 3 times, to do the same
thing with these 4 errands in the second parenthesis.

49
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,580
Again, it's a combination of the first 4 powers
of 2.

50
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,390
Going back to the table, it would match exactly
this line there with 1101.

51
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:42,630
Because 1101 basically stands for 1 times
2 to the 0, plus 0 times 2 to the 1, plus

52
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:49,350
1 times 2 to the second, plus 1 times 2 to
3, which is equivalent to 13, hexadecimal

53
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,880
D. but it's equivalent to 13.

54
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,110
So, this thing here is 13 times 2 to the power
of 4.

55
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,680
Same thing with these 4 errands, we’ll look
at the table.

56
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,950
It matches this line and it adds up to 6.

57
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,300
So, we can write 6 times 2 to the 8.

58
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,310
So, again, as we said it's not a coincidence
that our table there gave us all the combinations

59
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,510
of 4 bits.

60
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,680
Because when we do the math, we would get
some combination of the first 4 powers of

61
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,940
2: 2 to the 0 through 2 to the 3.

62
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,300
Now, let's take a look at the powers of 2
that we have there.

63
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,430
2 to the 0, 2 to the 4, and 2 to the 8, so
2 to the 0 is basically 1, which is also 16

64
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,640
to the power of 0.

65
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:46,250
You see like I'm getting us towards a hexadecimal
representation, something times powers of

66
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,030
16, so this would be 3 times 6 into the power
of 0.

67
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:58,830
Fortunately for us, actually it's not very
fortunate, it just works, 2 to the 4 is 16,

68
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,330
which is 16 to the power of 1.

69
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:09,080
So, this digit here is also 13 times a power
of 16, and 2 to the 8 is 2 to the 4 squared,

70
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,180
or in other words, 16 squared.

71
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,380
So, we get 6 times 16 squared.

72
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:28,520
So, we can view that as a hexadecimal representation
because it's 3 for the ones digit, 13 or D

73
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,200
for the tens digit, and 6 for the hexadecimal
hundreds digit.

74
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,530
So, that very long binary number is equivalent
to 6d3 hexidecimal.
