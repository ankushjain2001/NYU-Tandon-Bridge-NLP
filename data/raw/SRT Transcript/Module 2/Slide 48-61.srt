1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,230
Let's try to do the same.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,500
Now let's try counting in base five.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:13,970
So it would start zero, one, two, three, four,
and now in base five, we are grouping five

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,360
objects together.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,079
In base ten, ten objects (ten ones) were grouped
into a ten, ten tens were grouped into a hundred,

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,820
and so on in base five were grouping more
often.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:33,360
We're grouping five objects together so five
ones would be grouped into a base five-ten,

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,850
and five tens would be grouped to one hundred
and so on.

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:42,100
So now that we are counting the fifth object,
instead of having the single symbol a single

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:49,370
digit to represent five objects, we are using
one group of five objects and base five-ten

11
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,500
and zero additional ones.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,219
After that, we have eleven, twelve, thirteen,
and fourteen, and the next object would give

13
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,760
us, again, five ones, that would group to
another group of ten.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,910
So, we would have two groups of base five-ten
and zero additional ones.

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,340
And so on: twenty one, twenty two, up to one
hundred.

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,040
Can you think what comes before hundred?

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,570
I hope you said forty four, because after
forty four the next object would be five ones

18
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,780
that would be grouped to another ten, and
then we would have five tens that would be

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,790
Group to one base five-hundred.

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,700
No tens, no ones, and hundred and one, hundred
two, and so on.

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,090
In this case, the digits we needed to use
are only zero to four, because we don't need

22
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,570
any other symbols to represent numbers in
this kind of representation.

23
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,100
We are grouping the five objects together
so we only need to represent quantities of

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,070
zero, one, two, three, and four, as a single
object.
