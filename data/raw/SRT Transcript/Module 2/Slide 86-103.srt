00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,770
Weâ€™ll talk about the binary number system
in much more detail in a few minutes. But

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,679
let's take a look at another very important
number system: the hexadecimal number system.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,910
which is also called the base sixteen. Let's
start counting in base sixteen this time.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:26,770
So zero, one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, after nine. So now we

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:35,109
have a problem, because we are still not supposed
to group the ones to a ten at this stage,

6
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:42,980
right we are grouping only sixteen ones to
hexadecimal ten but we don't have any more

7
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:50,230
digits anymore symbols to use for a single
digit number. So, when we worked with the

8
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,769
number systems that are less than ten, I don't
know, the octave, the binary, we just used

9
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:59,570
a subset of the digits zero to nine. For the
octal, we use zero to seven. For binary, we

10
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,649
use zero to nine. But, now that we have a
bigger number system, in this case base sixteen,

11
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,750
we need additional symbols.

12
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:14,590
So, the common symbols for basics in common
digits for basic things is zero to nine, which

13
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:22,219
are the first ten digits we use anyway. And
then we need five more, that would be the

14
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:28,440
first five letters in the English alphabet
A.B.C. D. E. and F.. So after nine, instead

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:35,100
of grouping together and moving to the next
position, we still have a single digit number

16
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:42,200
represents the quantity of ten. That is A
and then we have B. C. D. E. and F. which

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,299
represents the amount of fifteen object, see
still a single digit number, and then the

18
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:56,000
sixteenth object would be grouped into a single
ten and the next position , a decimal ten

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,399
so we have one and zero additional ones. And
then we have eleven, twelve, thirteen, nineteen,

20
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:11,550
after nineteen comes. I hope you didn't say
twenty, it's 1a right? Because after one hexadecimal

21
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:17,760
ten and nine ones we have one hexadecimal
tens and ten ones that are still not grouped,

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:26,019
that is written 1a, after that we have 1b,
1c, up to 1f. After 1f, now comes the twenty,

23
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:32,440
because we are grouping sixteen ones into
a single hexadecimal ten. In this case, we

24
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,590
would have two tens and no additional ones.
Twenty one, twenty two, twenty three, up to

25
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:46,320
2f, then would come for thirty and so on.
Can you think what comes before one hundred?

26
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:54,489
Hope you said f.f. because it represents fifteen
tens and fifteen ones. The next one would

27
00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:00,810
be grouped into another ten then we would
have sixteen ten, grouped into one hundred

28
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,339
and so on.
