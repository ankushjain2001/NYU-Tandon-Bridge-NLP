1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,090
In order to get used to working in other number
systems, let's start with the most trivial

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,090
thing we can do.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,129
Letâ€™s start counting, and in order to be
able to count in different number systems,

4
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:16,209
let's take a deeper look at the decimal number
system in base ten.

5
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:22,670
How we and what we're doing in that number
system and then we'll try to generalize it

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,730
for other number systems as well.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:31,630
So let's start counting in the decimal number
system in base ten kind of going back to second

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,510
grade, but let's do that.

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,089
So, zero after that would come one, after
one would come two, three, four, five, six,

10
00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:42,770
seven, eight, nine.

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,800
Then, when we get to the tenth object, instead
of having a single symbol to represent the

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,719
amount (the quantity of ten), we grouped ten
ones into a single ten.

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:02,550
We have this ten in the second position in
our number and then we have zero additional

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,590
ones.

15
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,780
So one zero basically means one group of ten
and zero additional ones.

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,170
Then we have eleven, which is one group of
ten and a single addition of one, twelve,

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,280
thirteen, fourteen, up to nineteen.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,689
After that, when comes the next object having
a group of ten and ten ones, these ten ones

19
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:28,649
would be grouped into another group of ten,
so together we would have two groups of ten

20
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:30,000
and zero ones.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,090
And so it continues twenty one, twenty two,
and so on, up to, for example ninety nine.

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,439
And after ninety nine, the next object would
have ten ones that would be grouped into another

23
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:51,439
ten, therefore, would have ten tens and these
ten tens would be grouped into a single one

24
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,399
hundred that is represented in the next position.

25
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,960
So we have one of one hundred group, zero
of the tens groups, zero of the one.

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,229
And so on, it continues.

27
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,310
So this is what we do when we are counting
in base ten; how we look at the positions

28
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,290
of the digits in a decimal representation.

29
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,400
The digits we use in order to represent the
numbers are zero to nine, to represent all

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,590
the different values we can have in each position.

31
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,900
After nine, we're just not using this position
anymore we're grouping it and moving to the

32
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,150
next position.
