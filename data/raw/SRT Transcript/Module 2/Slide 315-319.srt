1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,060
Okay, now that we know how to add numbers
in different number systems, let's see how

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,290
we can subtract numbers in a different number
system.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:14,590
Again, let's start with decimal for practice,
and then try to generalize it to other number

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,590
systems as well.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,670
So, let's try to subtract 427 minus 192 decimal.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,430
So, we start with the ones right.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:30,590
7 minus 2 that would give us a 5, then we
try to subtract 2 minus 9 and that's a problem

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:39,430
because we can’t subtract 9 from 2, so we
would need to borrow an additional 10 tens,

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,550
actually in this case.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:52,500
So, instead of having 2 tens, we'll have 12
tens, and that by splitting the hundred, the

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,350
4 hundreds into 3 hundred and 10 tens.

12
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,230
That would leave us with 3 hundred and 10
tens additional 2 tens that would give a 312

13
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,230
ten.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:13,070
So, instead of saying 42 tens or 420, we say
312 tens.

15
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,810
Then we have these 12 tens minus 9 that would
give us a 3 and 300 minus 1, that would give

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,810
us a 2.

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:25,630
So 427 minus 192 is 235.

18
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,289
Let's try doing the same for the octal number
system.

19
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,799
Let’s try to subtract 351 from 536.

20
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:39,289
Same thing, we first subtract 1 from the 6
that would give us a 5, then when we try to

21
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:43,170
subtract 5 from 3, that is not possible.

22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,049
So, we need to split one of the hundreds,
one of the 5 hundred into tens.

23
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:58,450
So, instead of having 530, we would have 4
hundred and 13 ten.

24
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:05,090
So therefore, we have 13 tens that we need
to take 5 out of them.

25
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:14,320
So, let's count back out of thirteen, so it's
twelve, eleven, ten, seven, six.

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,310
So, we have 6 there, and 4 minus 3 is 1.

27
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,870
So, 536 minus 351 is 165 octal.
