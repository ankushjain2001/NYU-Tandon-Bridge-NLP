1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,021
Another example that we've got of a concurrency
control problem is one of a double update/missing

2
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:07,610
update situation.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:13,100
And in this scenario what we have is two pieces
of code: just a deposit function and it withdraw

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,100
function.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,230
So you can imagine a situation where you have
two ATM cards for the exact same bank account

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,189
and you go to the bank, not at not at nearly
the same time but literally at exactly the

7
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:29,859
same microsecond in time, and one person is
doing a deposit and the other person is doing

8
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:30,919
withdrawal.

9
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:35,690
And when we do that, we have two transactions
that are happening at the same time on different

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,690
processors.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,730
So, now we have the possibility of asynchrony
because we're dealing with this with separate

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,210
processors and symmetric multiprocessing.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,700
We're going to assume that the bank has a
good enough system that we have more than

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,309
one CPU, so we can expect that this these
pieces of code are running on two separate

15
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:53,719
processors at exactly the same time.

16
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,719
The biggest issue is that they share a balance,
and the balance starts out at one hundred

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,620
dollars and the first transaction is the deposit
which is fifty dollars and the second transaction

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,610
is the withdrawal of a hundred dollars.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,500
So, we can imagine a situation where two people
go to the bank at same time and one is depositing

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,010
fifty dollars, and the other is withdrawing
one hundred dollars.

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,720
Ultimately, what we should see is that the
bank balance is fifty dollars because we had

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,050
one hundred plus fifty minus one hundred and
I'm not great at math but that's pretty easy

23
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,270
to do and we'll say that that's fifty dollars.

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,210
So let's go out and see if that's really the
case.
