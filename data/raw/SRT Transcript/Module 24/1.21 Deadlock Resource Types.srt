1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:08,280
I've been talking about using locks, or using
a semaphore, but in reality we have two different

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,019
resource types that we can talk about when
we get into deadlocks.

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:15,250
One is reusable resource types, and the other
is consumable resource types.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:21,820
Now a reusable resource type happens when
we have a resource that we will temporarily

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,880
consume, for example, we will temporarily
take action on the resource, we will temporarily

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,820
take over control of that, resource.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,210
But then once we're done with it we'll return
the resource back to the operating system

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,460
or back to the the whole so it can be reused
again.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,470
So, examples of this include things like memory,
devices, data structures, even semaphores;

10
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,719
once we're done with these things we return
them back to their original state and they're

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
allowed to be used again.

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,680
But there's consumable resources, which once
we use it it's gone.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,460
For example, if we have an interrupt and we
deal with the interrupts, or we if you will

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,399
consume the interrupt, the interrupts can't
be replaced.

15
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,250
If we get a signal then the signal can't be
replaced; if we got a message then the message

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,140
cannot be replaced.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,700
If we're for example, processing data in an
IO buffer as you did in previous examples

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,189
where you read in from the keyboard, once
you read in that data there's an easy way

19
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,270
to put it back into the buffer.

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,220
So, consumable resource types, once they're
used they're gone, and the reason that we're

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,290
recognizing this is because how we deal with
a deadlock on these different resources is

22
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,310
going to be different from one resource type
to another.
