1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,140
In this model we're going to continue our
discussion of threads and we're going to talk

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,800
about some of the features of having threads
work together with one another.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,850
So we're going to talk just simply a quick
reminder about what threads are we're going

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,430
to talk about some features of having multiple
threads accessing multiple resources.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,800
We're going to have a discussion on ways that
we can end up with a synchrony and what a

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,170
synchrony is.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,660
We're going to talk about the idea of critical
sections.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,019
We're going to talk about concurrency issues.

9
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:31,659
We're going to explain mutual exclusion and
talk about some software and hardware options

10
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:34,000
or solutions for mutual exclusion.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,030
We're going to describe the operating system
semaphores and how they work.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,800
We're going to describe deadlocks and how
we can resolve deadlocks and then we're going

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,710
to talk about the dining philosophers problem
as a wrap up problem.

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,899
So there's a lot to go through in this module
and we'll get started immediately.
