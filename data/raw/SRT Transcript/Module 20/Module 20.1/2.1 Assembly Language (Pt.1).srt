1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,610
In this module, we will introduce some basic
concepts of assembly programming and then

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,710
correlate it to machine-level instruction
using a mnemonic format.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:15,490
More specifically, we will introduce some
basic assembly instructions in the MIPS architecture.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,660
We will then go in detail on how to map MIPS
assembly into MIPS mnemonic format, which

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,480
is the format we will be focusing on throughout
the class, and we will cover some registers

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,539
available in a typical MIPS architecture.
