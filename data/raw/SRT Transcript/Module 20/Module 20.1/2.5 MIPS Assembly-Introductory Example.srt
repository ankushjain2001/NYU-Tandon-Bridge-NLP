00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,390
Instead, we start by working with assembly
language.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,019
The assembly language is a symbolic representation
of the machine code.

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,370
In this respect, symbolic means it simplifies
some of the complexities of machine code by

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,519
using labels and symbols.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,400
Nevertheless, given a machine-level code,
there is a one-to-one mapping between a machine

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,500
instruction and an assembly instruction
