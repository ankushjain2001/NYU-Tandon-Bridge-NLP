1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,319
We have introduced MIPS assembly language
and covered some fundamental instructions.

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:09,920
We have also seen that, although assembly
has a one-to-one correlation to machine level

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,059
code, it doesnâ€™t fully illustrate how the
CPU executes the code.

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,369
We have then covered MIPS mnemonic notation,
which gives a good middle ground between assembly

5
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:19,830
and machine-level code.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:27,039
Next, we will use a tabular approach to illustrate
how the CPU updates registers and memory when

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,580
it executes instructions
