00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,310
To set the correct value of the Rs in the
jump register instruction, we need to first

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,190
understand the interaction between the jump
and link instruction the and jump register

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,310
instruction. Consider this use case of the
absolute value function. We have a header

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:21,100
file Lib dot H that holds the declaration
of the absolute value function and a c file

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,240
Lib dot C that holds its implementation. In
the main file, we call the absolute value

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,990
function. Recall that the jump and link instruction
is responsible for function calls. Jump and

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:39,109
Link does two things. It first sets the address
to return to after the function call in R31,

8
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:44,499
and then it jumps to the function. So in this
respect, the return address is in the R31

9
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:50,639
register and the jump register instruction
must use R31 to return from the call. Hence

10
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:55,089
Rs in the jump register instruction is equal
to R31.
