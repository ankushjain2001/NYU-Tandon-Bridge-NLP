1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,010
Remember, you must take the most significant
four bits of PC+4.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,980
The formula assumes that the program counter
is 32-bits.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,470
So if it's not, you must first pad it with
zeroes to make it 32 bits.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,550
Then take the most significant four bits [31:28]
of the result
