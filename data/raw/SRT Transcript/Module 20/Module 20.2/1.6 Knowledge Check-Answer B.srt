1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:07,790
When the application finishes its job, it
should, in fact it must, jump to the function

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:08,790
that calls it.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,610
This is usually an operating system function,
or another application.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,140
So it wouldn't jump to its own code if it
has finished executing.
