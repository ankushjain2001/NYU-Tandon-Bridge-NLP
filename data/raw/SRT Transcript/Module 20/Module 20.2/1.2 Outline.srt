Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:06,180
Today, we will cover the second half of the
computer architecture section of this course.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,379
We will focus on branch and jump instructions,
which are fundamental in all instruction set

4
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:12,570
architectures.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,449
We will discuss the purposes of these instructions,
how they are mapped to high-level C and C++

6
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:24,660
codes that we write every day, and we'll go
over two examples of their use cases.
