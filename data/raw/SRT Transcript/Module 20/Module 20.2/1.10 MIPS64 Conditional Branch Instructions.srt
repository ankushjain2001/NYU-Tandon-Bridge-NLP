00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,780
Let's now go over branch instructions in MIPS64.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:09,550
The two most fundamental branch instruction
in MIPS64 are Branch if equal, or BEQ, and

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,730
Branch if not equal, BNE.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,220
Both branch instructions use relative target
calculation and have the same Function, labeled

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,390
func2, to calculate the address of the target
instruction.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,359
Both instructions compare the values of two
registers to check their condition.

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,339
Branch if equal checks if the values of the
two registers are the same.

8
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,129
If so, the CPU branches to the calculated
target address.

9
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:40,210
Otherwise, the CPU goes to the next instruction
in the sequential code which is PC+4.

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,760
Branch if not equal checks if the values are
different.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,800
If that is the case, the CPU branches to the
calculated target address

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,250
Several other branch instructions derived
from branch if equal and branch if not equal.

13
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:01,539
Such instructions are Branch if equal to zero,
branch if not equal to zero, branch if less

14
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:07,040
than zero, branch if less than or equal to
zero, any many more.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:14,640
We focus primarily on branch if equal, branch
if not equal, and branch if equal to zero.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,970
There is one terminology that is commonly
used when talking about conditional branches.

17
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,750
It is the “branch is taken/not taken”
term.

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,440
When one says a branch is taken, it means
that the condition that the branch checks

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,990
is true and the CPU branches to the target
address calculated.

20
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,070
Branch not taken means the opposite.
