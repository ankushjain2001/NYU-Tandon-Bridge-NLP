00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,009
Let's go over the func2 formula that calculates
the target addresses for branch instructions.

2
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:11,130
Since branches use relative address calculation,
the formula uses the program counter of the

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,000
branch instruction.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,680
In addition, the formula uses a 16-bit immediate
parameter that we label as do immediate.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,199
Here is a little bit more detail on the formula
for func2.

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,529
It first takes the program counter and increments
it by 4.

7
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:31,050
Recall that in this situation, the value of
the program counter is the address of the

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,890
branch instruction.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,430
It then takes the 16-bit immediate value and
sign-extend it to 32 bits.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,100
In the third step, the formula takes the sign
extended immediate value and shift it left

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,400
by two.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,160
This has the same effect as multiplying it
by 4.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,350
The final step adds the results from step
1 and 3 to get a 32-bit target address.

14
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,440
Here is an example to illustrate how func2
works.

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,500
We have a branch if equal instruction with
the program counter and the do immediate parameter

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,170
given.

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,680
The first step adds 4 to the program counter
and the second step sign extends the do immediate

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,270
value.

19
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:20,479
Since the Do Immediate is a positive value,
the sign extension simply pads zeroes to make

20
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,460
it 32 bits.

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,549
The third step takes the sign-extended Do
Immediate and multiplies it by four, and the

22
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:34,939
last step adds the results of step 1 and step
3 to get the target address highlighted
