1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,650
One instruction that is strongly correlated
with branch instructions is SLT or Set less

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,050
than instruction.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,180
SLT uses three registers, Rd, Rs and Rt.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,080
It checks if Rs is less than Rt.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,070
If so, it sets Rd to 1.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,910
Otherwise, it sets Rd to 0

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,220
Several branch instructions in MIPS64 are
formed by combining SLT with either branch

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,640
if equal or branch if not equal.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,790
For example, Branch if less than zero can
be formed by SLT and branch if equal as the

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,380
example here shows.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,950
A similar method can be used for Branch if
greater than zero instruction.
