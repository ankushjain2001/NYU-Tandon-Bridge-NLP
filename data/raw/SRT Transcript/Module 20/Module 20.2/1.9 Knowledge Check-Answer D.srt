1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,700
That is correct.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,540
We first took the address parameter, which
is 13 bit, shift it left by 2 which has the

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,140
same effect as multiplying it by 4 given us
four EC.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,390
Since the most significant four bits of the
program counter is zero, then the final answer

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,929
itself is 4EC
