1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:02,580
The code is still not complete.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,810
More specifically, we need to replace the
Do immediate parameter with its correct value

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,450
in the branch if equal instruction.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,920
And we need to set the correct value of Rs
in the jump register instruction.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,160
To calculate Do immediate, we can simply use
the inverse of the func2 formula.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,070
This is the formula that we use to calculate
the target address of branch instructions.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,060
Based on the inverse formula of func2, we
use the values of the target address and the

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,399
address of the branch instruction to calculate
the do immediate.

9
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,109
Our result shows that Do immediate is 1.
