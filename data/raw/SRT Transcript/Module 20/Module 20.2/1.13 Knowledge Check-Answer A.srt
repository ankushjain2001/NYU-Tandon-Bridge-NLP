1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:02,880
We first check if the branch condition is
true.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,140
R8 is 3 and R0 is always 0.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,840
Since the branch condition checks if the registers
are not equal, it is indeed true.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,480
Therefore, the CPU goes to the target address
and doesn't go to PC+4.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,140
Use the formula in func2 to calculate the
target address.
