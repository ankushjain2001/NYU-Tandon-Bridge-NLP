1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,899
We still need to determine what is the value
of the do immediate parameter in our branch

2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,229
if not equal instruction.

3
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:12,750
For that, we use the reverse of the func2
formula to get Do Immediate sign extended.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,789
We use the same approach as before the get
the inverse of func2 and use the inverse to

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,039
get the value Do Immediate.

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,500
We observe that this Do Immediate is a negative
value.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,130
Looking back at the complete code, we can
see why Do Immediate is negative.

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,650
This is because if the branch is taken, we
go back up in the code.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,500
When the value is positive, as it was in the
previous example, the branch was taken; we

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,570
went down in the code.
