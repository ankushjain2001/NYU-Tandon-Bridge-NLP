1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,719
That is correct.

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:07,059
The branch not equal instruction checks if
the two registers are not equal; in our case

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:10,730
r8 is 3 and R0 is always 0.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:16,129
So the two registers are indeed not equal,
so the branch condition is true and the branch

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:16,700
is taken.
