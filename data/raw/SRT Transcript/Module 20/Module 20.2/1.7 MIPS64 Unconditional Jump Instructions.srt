00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,560
Let us now detail the MIPS64 jump instructions.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,760
There are three such instructions: Jump, Jump
and Link, and Jump register.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,110
Jump is commonly used when performing unconditional
jumps within a function or procedure.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,250
This can be used for example for goto statements.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,650
Jump and Link is used for function calls and
has two jobs: it first saves the return address

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,130
in the R31 register, and then updates the
program counter to the address of first instruction

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,440
of the function.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,330
Note that the return address in this case
is the address of the instruction we must

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,520
return to when the function call has completed.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,470
Jump register is used to return from a function
call.

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:53,510
Jump and Jump and link both use relative jump,
whereas Jump register uses indirect jump and

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,870
holds the address of the target instruction
in a register.
