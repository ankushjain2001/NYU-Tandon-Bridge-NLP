1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,530
That is correct.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,929
If the unconditional jump instruction jumped
to itself, then the target address will be

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:09,360
again the unconditional jump instruction.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,240
Therefore, the unconditional jump instruction
will continually jump to itself over and over

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,390
again resulting in an infinite loop.
