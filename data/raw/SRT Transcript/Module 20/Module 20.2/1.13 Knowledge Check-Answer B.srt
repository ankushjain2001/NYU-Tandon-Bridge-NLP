1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,210
First, we compare the branch condition.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,730
Is R8 not equal to zero?

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,730
Yes.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,660
So the branch is taken and the CPU branches
to the target address.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,639
Now use the formula in func2 to see if the
target address is the end of the application
