1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,550
That is correct.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,480
First, you took negative 4, convert it into
hexadecimal which is FFFC.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,580
Then we took the original value of R8 add
it to our hexadecimal value of negative four,

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,710
and the answer is correct.
