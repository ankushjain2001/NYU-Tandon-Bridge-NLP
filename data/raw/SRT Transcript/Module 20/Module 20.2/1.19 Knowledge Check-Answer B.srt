1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,930
Pay close attention to the inverse formula
of func2.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,720
Note that that program counter is incremented
by four.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,250
Also remember, shift right by 2 is the same
as divide by four.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,799
And this division is the last operation of
the inverse formula.
