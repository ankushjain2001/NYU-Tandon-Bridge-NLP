1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,540
We're going to look at what the operating
system has to do to take care of all of main

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,130
memory, all of the RAM in the system, and
there's a lot that has to be done.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,410
So, in this module we're going to cover what
the needs are for memory management: some

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,390
requirements that we have to meet for memory
management.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,840
We're going to talk about logical addresses
and physical addresses and how to convert

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,930
between them.

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,220
We're going to talk about a few partitioning
strategies for dividing up main memory.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,410
We're going to talk about what is virtual
memory, when it's in use, how it works, and

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,410
that sort.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,890
We're going to talk about working set, and
resident set strategies related to virtual

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,930
memory, and what the those definitions are.

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,160
We're going to talk about load control and
we're going to talk about how pages and memory

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,480
can be shared between processes.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,280
So, we’ve got a lot to cover in this module;
let’s get to it.
