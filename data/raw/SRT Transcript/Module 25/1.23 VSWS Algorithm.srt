00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:08,019
The variable interval sampled working set
or VSWS algorithm tries to solve PFF’s problems

2
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,769
by setting a number of different parameters.

3
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:15,820
The first one is an M value, a minimum value
for clearing out the unused pages.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,300
If we’re ever below M, we’re always going
to add on a new page.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,490
If the page fault ever happens below M, we
always add on a new page.

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:31,850
Then we set a Q value, and we say if we're
above M and we've reached Q page faults.

7
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,350
We've had Q page faults since the last time
we reset all the used bits and threw out the

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,480
unused pages, then let's go ahead and do that
algorithm again.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:48,290
So between M, above M and above Q, we would
throw out all the unused pages and reset the

10
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,510
use bits.

11
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,440
Even if we’re above M, but we've only had
a very small number of page faults then it's

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,629
too much work to go through the whole algorithm
of resetting the used bits and throwing out

13
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,420
the unused pages; so, we'll just add a page.

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,250
But once we get to L, L is the maximum limit.

15
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,230
Once we get to L time units then it's time.

16
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,780
It doesn't matter how many page faults we've
had; this process had its chance.

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,660
It's now time to throw out the unused pages,
reset the use bits ,and let the process run

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,660
again.

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,620
So, even if we don't get a page fault by the
time we get to L, we now say it's time to

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,340
run this algorithm and clear out the old waste.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:32,410
And that's the point that VSWS solves the
PFF shortcomings by through setting the L

22
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:37,830
value to say that even if we haven't had a
large number of page faults by the time we

23
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:44,010
reach L, there's got to be some stale information
there and we'll throw out that that old locality’s

24
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,010
information.

25
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:50,050
So, it does actually solve the problems of
PFF and it actually works fairly effectively.
