1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,360
So in this module, we took a look at the two
fundamental data structures in C++ that we

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,720
use stacks and cues.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,360
And we saw how they work with how they were
implemented and what they're used for.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,260
Hopefully have a better understanding of how
a stack works, how a queue works, and you

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,110
also can produce one if you had to yourself.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:25,100
Now, fortunately, of course the STL took care
of all this for us so if we needed a stack

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,780
we could just pounding include stack and we
get stack, and if we needed a queue we could

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,910
just pound include queue and we end up with
a queue.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,100
And all the features are there; all the functions
are there.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,640
We have to push, the pop, the enqueue and
the dequeue, and you can use those without

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,980
having to build it yourself.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,430
But even if you had to build yourself, you
realize now that it's only a couple of lines

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,489
of code and it's not really going to take
much to store it.

14
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,949
So I hope you enjoyed that module and weâ€™ll
see you for the next one.
