00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,830
First, we need a definition of an operating
system and what I've come up with as a definition

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,309
is: a program that controls execution of application
programs and acts as an interface between

3
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:12,500
applications and computer hardware.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,559
And we're going to delve into that a lot more
in later slides.

5
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,150
But what I want you to understand here is
that the operating system is a piece of software;

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,550
it's not a component of the of the computer.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,619
So contrary to Apple's view when you buy a
computer, you don't necessarily buy an operating

8
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,550
system and that you can mix and match which
operating systems you want on which hardware

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,140
with some limitations.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,970
Now the operating system does interact directly
with system hardware and it has to be very

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,160
closely matched to that system hardware.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,181
So, it's not like we can mix and match any
operating system with any hardware; there

13
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,190
has to be some compatibility concerns there.

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,950
But if we take a look at the hardware for
example that Apple uses on all of their laptops

15
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,250
and desktops.

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,880
It's the exact same hardware as any PC In
fact, the CPU is the same, the system bus

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,759
is the same, the DMA controllers the same,
the interrupt controllers the same; all of

18
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:18,590
it is exactly the same as one made by HP or
Dell or any other PC manufacturer.

19
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:24,070
What makes the huge difference is the operating
system, and Apple has designed its operating

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:29,819
system only to work with their hardware, but
the operating system is a piece of software

21
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:30,819
fundamentally.

22
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:34,909
And it runs on the same processor as the user's
program code.

23
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:39,020
So, your programs that you're writing, your
‘hello world’ applications that you're

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:46,200
writing, those are running on the processor
which is the same processor as the operating

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
system.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,759
So, we don't have more than one processor
in the system; let's keep it simple and consider

27
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,810
a system that doesn't have multi processors,
uni-processor systems what we call it.

28
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,420
The operating system has to divide the time
between itself running code for the operating

29
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,149
system to manage the hardware and manage the
execution of the whole system, and actually

30
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,530
running your program that you really care
about.

31
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,330
What the operating system doesn't include
is applications.

32
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,690
And this is going to be a big difference for
you to understand, because we'll talk about

33
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,950
it in a later slide.

34
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,200
When you go and buy an operating system from
Microsoft or something like that what you

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,880
get is a lot more than just the operating
system so, we're going to talk about that.

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,510
But I want you to think of the operating system
as the fundamental hard software that goes

37
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,940
along with the hardware for the computer.

38
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,330
It doesn't have to be directly matched to
the exact hardware; there can be some compatibility

39
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,450
for multiple operating systems to multiple
hardware.

40
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:55,200
But fundamentally we can talk about the operating
system being a piece of software that manages

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,830
this system hardware and runs applications.
