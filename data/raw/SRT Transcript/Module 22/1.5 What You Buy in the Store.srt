1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,310
I want you to consider that when you go to
the Comp USA, or I guess Comp USA doesn't

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,310
exist anymore.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:12,299
If you go to Best Buy or even if you go to
the Microsoft store and you buy Windows, what

4
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:17,460
you're buying is not an operating system;
you're buying a lot of other stuff in that

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,460
operating system.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,390
In that box comes a CD that is filled with
ninety nine percent stuff that has nothing

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,170
to do with your operating system.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,080
The operating system as we're concerned is
the kernel, and the kernel in Microsoft Windows

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,591
for example is about twenty five megabytes.

10
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:40,900
Now you say what comes on a CD for four gigs
when the operating system itself is only twenty

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,800
five or thirty megabytes, well all the other
stuff.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,100
The extra stuff that you get are web browsers,
like Edge (I don't know who's using Edge yet)

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:55,760
but let's say Edge, Internet Explorer, text
editors, device drivers, really any other

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,860
application that comes on that CD, calculator,
minesweeper, solitaire.

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,700
those will come with the CD but they have
nothing to do with the operating system.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,930
Linux on the other hand, for example, you
can just download the kernel.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,870
If you go to www.kernel.org; you can see that
what you can download is just the kernel.

18
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,140
It comes with no text editors, it comes with
no web browsers, it comes with some device

19
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,280
drivers for stuff that supported directly
in Linux.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,490
But fundamentally the thing that we want to
concern ourselves with is this kernel.

21
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,420
And the kernel is really only the very small
components that, we'll talk about this and

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,280
in a later slide, but really the just the
very small components that are necessary to

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,480
bring the system up online and start running
other programs.

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,460
And really that's not very much but what you
buy in the store is a lot more stuff.
