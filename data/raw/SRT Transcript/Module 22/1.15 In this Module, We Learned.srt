00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,270
So, we covered a real basic of operating systems;
think just kind of the intro stuff.

We talked about what an operating system is,
we looked at some history of operating system.

We talked about a lot of things and we're
going to keep going with that.

00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,840

more of that we're going to cover on operating

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,680
systems, including further discussions on
processes and scheduling.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,510
We're going to talk about memory management.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,350
We're going to talk about threads and concurrency

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,640
