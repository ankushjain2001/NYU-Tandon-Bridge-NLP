1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:04,240
It's time to start talking about operating
systems and in this module we're going to

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,870
cover a few things about operating systems
and get you prepared for the future modules

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,940
which cover the rest of operating systems
concerns or at least some of the basics of

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,320
operating systems.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,680
What we want to take away from this is a fundamental
understanding of how computer operating systems

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,080
first work and what they're expected to do,
and then how we can understand them and utilize

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,720
them either as programmers or if you want
operating systems designers.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,840
So, in this module we're going to cover what
is an operating system.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,460
We're going to cover a little bit history
of operating systems, so you can understand

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,710
how we got to this point today.

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,520
We're going to talk about preemption and how
we do scheduling of different programs that

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
are running on the system.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,740
And then I'm going to talk about a basic architecture
of an operating system.
