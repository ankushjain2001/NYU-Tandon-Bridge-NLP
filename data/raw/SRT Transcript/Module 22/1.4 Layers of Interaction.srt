1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,180
It's good to have an idea, at least a visual,
of what we're talking about where the OS is

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,180
concerned.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,000
So, the thing that you've probably experienced
as users of computers and we've all been users

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,560
of computers basically our whole lives we
interact with applications.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,109
So, as a user, we are only interacting with
the application side of the computer.

6
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:28,310
So, when we look at Visual Studio, or when
we look at our Web browser, or when we watch

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,429
this video we're interacting with an application.

8
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:35,630
And we can control that application; we can
choose which website we're viewing, we can

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,820
type code into Visual Studio, or you can pause
and restart this video.

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,090
Don't pause and restart this video right now.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,540
The thing that applications do is they'll
interact with the operating system.

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,580
So, in order for the for the application to
do what it needs to do, it needs to communicate

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,160
with the operating system.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,270
For example, this video is going to need to
accept from the operating system a stream

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:06,590
of data from the network, and then process
that data and then display it on the screen.

16
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,799
So, we're using the operating system both
to read the data in as well as produce an

17
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,310
image on the screen as well as produce the
sound of my voice on the audio.

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,609
So, the application is going to use services
that the operating system provides to get

19
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:22,609
that done.

20
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:26,079
In your ‘hello world’ programs that you've
written before you've opened up files and

21
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,229
just the act of opening up a file is an operating
system call; it’s what we call a system

22
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:32,229
call.

23
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,219
We're asking the operating system for some
help.

24
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:39,929
So, as the application programmer, you've
interacted with the operating system by calling

25
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:46,789
a function like open and when an open opens
the file it was using the service of the operating

26
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,119
system.

27
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,729
The operating system of course is going to
need to interact with system hardware.

28
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:57,619
So, in order to open that file, it's got to
read from the hard drive and so the operating

29
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:02,680
system directly communicates with System hardware
to get the job done.

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,189
These are the layers of interaction that you
see.

31
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,920
So, the user is never directly interacting
with the operating system and the operating

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,530
so the application is never directly interacting
with system hardware; everything is insulated.
