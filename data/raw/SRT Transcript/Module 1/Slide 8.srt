1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,380
So the brain of the computer is what's known
as the central processing unit or the CPU

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,080
and this is where all of the processing, all
of the data processing, all the commands that

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,340
we're going to run inside of a computer.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,260
This is where all that is done.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,859
It is a single piece of silicon in the form
of a chip designed and manufactured by a company

6
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:31,570
like Intel or AMD. or there's a few others
that produce these chips, and this is the

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:37,210
only location in the entire system where code
can actually be run.

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,319
Now the code that's going to run here is not
the code that we're going to write, at least

9
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:43,760
not in the first parts of this course.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,399
The code that we're going to write in the
first part of this course is what's known

11
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,569
as a high level language and the CPU only
runs machine language code.

12
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:55,920
Machine language code is not easy to write
and we will do something a little bit like

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,319
it but it will then convert to machine language
code.

14
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:06,159
In short machine language codes for machines
and human code is for… higher level code

15
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,240
is for humans.

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,520
The CPU operates on a fetch, decode, execute
cycle which we'll talk about in just a little

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,610
bit, but it runs this cycle very very quickly
and when it's running this cycle each CPU

18
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,350
has its own set of instructions which it understands.

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,219
So the CPU has a language for itself if you
will.

20
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:35,070
Each CPU really only has a small amount of
memory, there's not a lot of memory inside

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,659
the CPU and those are called registers.

22
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:42,930
And the registers are where we store information
temporarily, in order to do the immediate

23
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,039
processing.

24
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:47,430
But we only have a few of these registers
so we have to be…

25
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,530
When we're writing machine language code,
we have to be very careful to use them without

26
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,240
wasting the memory.

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,789
And the CPU may have a cache memory which
can perform more quickly than main memory,

28
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,249
but it's not really much of a concern for
us because as programmers we don't have a

29
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:11,330
lot of capability for working with cache memory,
in terms of what's inside the CPU.
