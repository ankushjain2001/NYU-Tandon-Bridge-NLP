1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,000
In this first module we just want to give
everybody a start off with a basis on what

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,450
a computer is and how it works.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,910
In the future modules we're going to be doing
a lot of programming.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,549
We're going to be doing a lot of operating
systems concerns.

5
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:17,119
We're going to be doing a lot of things that
you need to know about what goes on inside

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,930
the computer and so in this module we just
like to start you off with the very basis

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,360
of what's inside the computer and how things
work.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,150
We don't know what your background is we don't
know where you come from or what your history

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,539
is so if some of this is a little bit basic,
then we apologize but for everybody we'd

10
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:36,050
like to start off on the same foot.
