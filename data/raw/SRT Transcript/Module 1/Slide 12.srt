1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,230
The instructions and all the data has to come
from somewhere.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,520
And in order for the code to be executed it
has to be in a register built into the CPU,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,420
that one that we spoke about called the instruction
register.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,160
So why don't we just load all of the code
directly into the CPU and then run it directly

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,180
from there.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,289
The unfortunate fact is that the amount of
memory inside of a CPU is really measured

7
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:25,289
in bytes.

8
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,289
It's a very small amount of memory.

9
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:32,870
So it doesn't fit a lot of code in fact we
really only want to store one instruction

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,829
directly inside the CPU and the reason that
is because each additional byte of memory

11
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:44,960
costs a really significant amount of money
to add to each CPU and the manufacturers of

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,820
these CPU's like Intel and A.M.D. want to
keep the costs down as much as possible so

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,770
we can store everything in registers because
it's just too expensive so what we do is we

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,860
create a memory hierarchy whereby each layer
of the hierarchy adds a little bit more space

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,140
and costs a little bit less but in addition
it runs a little bit slower.

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,180
And we'll see that.
