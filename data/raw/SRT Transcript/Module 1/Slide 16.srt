00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,100
As you can see from this, this is what looks
like a physical RAM stick or it's known as

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,760
a dual inline memory module.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,610
What we have here is a printed circuit board
or a PCB with a number of chips.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,279
This one is made by Samsung Corp.

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,790
Each of the individual chips store a certain
amount of RAM.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,080
Regardless you can't really peer into it and
look at what's going on and as soon as you

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,540
pull the power out everything's lost anyhow.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:35,640
So the basic idea here is that you have a
physical device in which we can temporarily

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,850
store some information.
