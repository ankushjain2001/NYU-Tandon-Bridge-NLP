1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,960
So there's a lot of different ways that computers
can be connected physically.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,180
And we want to take a look at a few of those
in the most popular ones that have come up

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,610
with are copper, fiber, and wireless.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:20,870
The copper is your standard Ethernet cable
or any sort of physical cable that involves

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,430
a metallic connection, and that's usually
called copper because it's usually made up

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,990
of copper.

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,760
Very commonly inside of a copper cable there
might be eight wires, four pairs of cables

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,149
and they're twisted together in a form of
an unshielded twisted pair or you might have

9
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,710
heard UTP cable so that's the idea behind
a copper physical connection.

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,390
Fiber is an Advent that's come out in the
past thirty years and it's actually where

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,140
we transmit information via light on a piece
of glass.

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,840
That's a cable but it can transmit with a
lot less attenuation, so we lose a lot less

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,100
information in that data transfer via light
and it can go a lot farther distances.

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,369
So fiber cables go faster and they travel
longer distances, unfortunately they cost

15
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:15,560
a lot more too because it's glass.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,409
And then the latest one is wireless, we've
had wireless only for about the past twenty

17
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:23,599
years and it's certainly taken off.

18
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,560
We see wireless virtually everywhere usually
in the form of a wifi connection which we'll

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,869
talk about.

20
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:34,329
But wifi is only one type of wireless and
we have to understand that there's quite a

21
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:38,889
few types of wireless including microwave
and a lot of others.

22
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:43,759
Protocols are in use for a lot of situations,
for example we want to know when we need to

23
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,539
start sending data, we want to know who it's
coming from, we want to know who it's going

24
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,539
to.

25
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:53,020
In terms of physical connections, the idea
of a protocol is very important because it's

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,950
a language, it's a language that two computers
are going to be talking and each of them have

27
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,509
to understand the complete language.

28
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,309
So we need to know, we need to have a very
well defined protocol and thankfully we do.

29
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:11,909
As far as physical connections are concerned
we can talk about ethernet and ethernet physical

30
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:19,060
connection would define both the protocol
and the type of connection so we might have

31
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,430
for example one hundred base T, which is a
fast ether net connection better known as

32
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:32,129
Fast ethernet, that's one hundred megabit
connection of ethernet over copper and it

33
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,660
defines how we would communicate; it defines
when we start sending data, it defines when

34
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:44,159
we stop sending data, and it defines the format
for information that's being passed over that

35
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,159
network.

36
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,620
So we have a lot of these different protocols
including wifi which you've heard of as the

37
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:56,790
802.11 group, the 802.11 group is defined
by the IEEE and it has a lot of different

38
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,569
sub working groups for example 802.11B was
the original one that produced eleven megabit

39
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:08,749
wifi and we've 802.11N, and AC, and there's
a lot of different letters that go associated

40
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:14,550
with that and then we have ATM which is asynchronous
transfer mode which is used in a lot of backbone

41
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,549
networks for transmission of high capacity
links.

42
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:25,519
So all of these are our physical types of
connections that we would have to physically

43
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,440
connect to multiple computers to a network.
