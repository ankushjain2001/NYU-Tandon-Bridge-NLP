00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,050
As you can see from the images, what we have
here on the top is a spinning hard drive and

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,320
you can see that magnetic disk that I was
talking about there.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,760
The head is the component that looks like
a straight line and that one is in what's

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,870
known as a parking location right now once
the disk spins up.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:22,910
It would come off that parking location and
move to different radii along the disk and

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:30,160
that this would just continue spinning along
until the read operation was complete or until

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,870
the drive was shut down completely.

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,899
So one of the issues that come up with a hard
disk drive is that it does waste a lot of

9
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:43,210
energy to move that disk physically, so there
is quite a bit of energy savings in in going

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,300
with the solid state disk drive, which is
along the bottom, and there's a performance

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,890
benefit also for solid state disks.

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,530
Unfortunately the downside is with a solid
state disk you get significantly less storage

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,569
than with a hard disk drive.
