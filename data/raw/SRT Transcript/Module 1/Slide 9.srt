00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,600
Computers only understand very basic commands
and I've listed some of the commands here,

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,089
so you can see them: move, add, subtract,
multiply, compare, and jump.

3
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:17,930
You're not seeing any of the higher level
commands that you might see in a high level

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,930
language.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,410
So there's really no function calls; there's
not a lot of not a lot of commands that we

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,289
would see except for very basic math operations.

7
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:33,430
There are a lot of machine language instructions,
but this set of machine language instructions

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,070
is limited and we can't really add to it.

9
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,190
The machine language instructions are designed
physically into the chip.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:49,350
So the chip is programmed by its manufacture
and it's written in silicone in the chip.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,780
So we canâ€™t expand on that we have no capability
to add instructions, but we have the capability

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,679
to build higher level languages and make the
higher level languages convert to the machine

13
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,850
language instructions.
