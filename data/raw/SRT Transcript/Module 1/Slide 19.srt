00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,380
Since we now live in a globally connected
world.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,970
We now understand the data can come from a
variety of sources literally around the world

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,410
or even part of it, right?

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,510
The ISS has connections to the Internet, so
we might be talking with somebody on the Internet

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,900
and they might not even be on Earth.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,880
Networks are connected via the Internet and
we can access data anywhere on our network,

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,619
so now we can really access data from anywhere.

8
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:33,540
And it's important to understand how that
data comes in and how that data moves around

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,550
the Internet and around networks.

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,690
So that's where we're going to talk about.
