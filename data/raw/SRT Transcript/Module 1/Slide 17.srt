1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:07,560
So the secondary storage can be broken down
into two types, and this is kind of representing

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,059
a change in the industry as we are today we're
moving from hard disk drives to solid state

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:15,609
disk drives for a lot of computers.

4
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:18,250
Now hardest drives are not going away by any
means.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,320
Hard disk drives are also known as spinning
drives and the reason for that is that they

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,990
contain magnetic material which is in the
form of a disk and the disk rotates at a constant

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,020
velocity, and it's measured in a number of
revolutions per minute.

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,600
And that's published by the manufacturer usually
is fifty four hundred RPM or seventy two hundred

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,740
RPM or possibly even ten thousand RPM.

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,440
The disk rotates and we have a head that moves
in and out along the disk for different radii

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:53,580
on the disk and this allows us to define,
by polar coordinates, a particular radius

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:02,990
with a particular rotation angle and a height
(the head) to indicate a specific point on

13
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,829
the disk where we want to either read or write.

14
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:12,140
So we can access the entire magnetic material
which is where the real storage happens.

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,789
Unfortunately with this system if we move
the head, which has some time that it takes

16
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:23,999
to move, if we move the head to the innermost
radius and then do a read operation and then

17
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:29,490
try and move the head to the outermost radius,
it really takes a significant amount of time

18
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,229
in comparison to move in the head to an adjacent
radius.

19
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:37,990
So what we call the each radius is known as
a track, and it looks like a track if you

20
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,639
were running around in a in a gym.

21
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:48,109
Each track can hold a certain amount of information
and the tracks are all adjacent to one another

22
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:52,929
but moving from one track to the next adjacent
track takes a very insignificant amount of

23
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:57,600
time, I shouldnâ€™t say insignificant, it
still takes an amount of time, but moving

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,170
from an inner most track to a very far distant
track will take quite a significant amount

25
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,170
of time.

26
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,960
In addition to that we have this rotation
that happens and on a drive with, for example

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,420
a fifty four hundred RPM, we can recognize
that it takes eleven milliseconds to do one

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,489
full rotation of the disc.

29
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:23,170
So if we move the head to the appropriate
location and happen to notice that the sector

30
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,640
that we want to read, the location where we
wanted to read just went past, it's going

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,090
to take eleven milliseconds for that to come
around again.

32
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,670
So that could take some significant time,
also.

33
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:39,010
The benefit to having a hard disk drive is
that the size can be enormous, sizes of four

34
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,780
terabytes six terabytes are not usual today.

35
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,159
So these sizes are really significant amount
of storage space.

36
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,810
The unfortunate downside is that accessing
that storage does take a little bit of extra

37
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,739
time with a solid state disk drive, which
is where a lot of the industry is moving to

38
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,400
for most end user machines.

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,890
This solid state destroy don't have anything
that moves, hence the term solid state.

40
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,170
They contain a number of chips which look
just like your USB flash drives, if you ever

41
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,349
happen to accidentally crack one of those
open.

42
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:16,909
All the data is stored electrically in the
chips and it looks very much like RAM chips,

43
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:21,970
but the chips are in a very different design,
the chips are designed very differently.

44
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:28,049
These are store data permanently, so that
even if the power is removed from the chip

45
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,530
the data is still stored which is a great
thing because this is secondary storage and

46
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,310
we don't want to lose the data if the power
is removed.

47
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,879
Thankfully with solid state disk drives, all
the data can be accessed in random time and

48
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,349
they can all be accessed in the same amount
of time.

49
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,900
So accessing the first byte on the drive and
then accessing the last byte on the drive

50
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,730
doesn't take any additional amount of time
other than the first or the second bite.

51
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,849
Unfortunately due to the cost and design of
these drives they're much smaller, so solid

52
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,930
state drive are significantly smaller, they're
a little bit more expensive but hard drives

53
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,599
are larger, and they're cheaper but they perform
slower.

54
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,989
So again we have the memory hierarchy working
here just inside of the term of secondary

55
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:15,989
storage.

56
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,340
So even inside secondary storage we still
have this concept of a memory hierarchy working.
