1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,220
So all computers every computer will have
at least one central processing unit and the

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,180
central processing unit is the brain of the
computer.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,020
That's where all the real work is done.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,519
Main memory â€“ main memory is where the code
and the data are stored, but main memory has

5
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:21,080
got to be temporary storage because once we
turn the computer off all of that is lost.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,550
And then because we're going to need some
sort of a permanent storage system, there's

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,830
got to be a secondary storage system where
the information is stored permanently.

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,440
Of course all computers are going to have
something that relates all those, so that

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,320
they can communicate.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,870
Most computers are also going to have a video
graphics controller where images can be rendered

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,500
and we can put them on display on a screen.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,710
They'll also probably have a network interface
so that we can communicate on the Internet

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,400
or in the local area network.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,760
And then of course they're probably going
to have a peripheral interface which is a

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,230
USB or a Thunderbolt, or a Firewire, or a
SCSI.

16
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,329
And all of these components meet the requirements
so that we can bring data into the computer,

17
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,600
we can process that data, and then we can
produce output.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
And if you look back at each one of these
individual items that I've mentioned you're

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,310
going to see that they either do one thing
or two things: input processing or output

20
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,950
and that's the basic idea.

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,150
Most devices inside the computer are either
IO devices or they're processing.
