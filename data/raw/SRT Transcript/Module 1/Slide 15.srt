00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,769
RAM is another term that we use for main memory
and that's because of it's the way it's constructed

2
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:12,560
it's known as random access memory because
any place in the memory can be accessed in

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,230
the same amount of time, which in computer
science is known as random time.

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,260
So we can access any byte of main memory at
the same amount of time.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,590
The areas of main memory inside RAM are broken
down into bytes and each byte is access independently,

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,090
so we can access all of the bytes of main
memory as individual bytes or we can group

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,690
them together in terms of known as a word
or D word or cue word double word or quad

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,280
word.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,570
Usually they're accessed in terms of the data
types which we're accessing might have a particular

10
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,570
size.

11
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,809
So for example in C++ it's very common to
have an integer which is a size of four bytes

12
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:55,999
which is equivalent to a D word or double
word.

13
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:00,500
Unfortunately was RAM, as we said when the
computers turned off everything in RAM is

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,360
lost, all of it is completely erased and that's
by virtue of its design.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,320
So once the electrical power is shut down
to RAM, then the RAM no longer contains any

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,090
information.

17
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,009
When running a program all the machine language
instructions are brought into RAM and then

18
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:23,310
there one by one pulled by the CPU during
the fetch and execute cycle into that instruction

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,139
register and then process.

20
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:31,899
So RAM is an absolutely critical portion of
the system and we have to know how it works

21
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:32,759
in order to use.
