00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:04,220
Here's the code for deleting a node if it
has no children.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,149
And what we're given is a pointer to this
node, actually it's a reference to a pointer

3
00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:09,149
to this node.

4
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:12,860
The reason for that is that we're going to
be changing the pointer; we actually make

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,839
a change so that temp pointer.

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,400
So, what we do is to say if temps left is
equal to the null pointer and temps right

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,680
is equal to the null pointer: it just it has
no children.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,630
So, there's no there's no work that really
has to be done here.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,290
We’ll find out if the parent is the null
pointer, if it is then this is the root node

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,130
of the tree; it has no children if the last
note on the tree were done.

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,260
So, we can just set root equal to null pointer.

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,400
So, if we’re removing the last node in the
tree just remove the node.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,820
And then of course will have to delete it
later.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,570
And then we'll check to see if the parents
left is equal to this node.

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,720
So, if the parents left is equal to the node
that we're looking at, so we go up a level

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,140
and then we go back to the left then we're
going to have to set the parents left pointer

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,480
equal to the null pointer.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,380
Remember this node has no children at all;
so if the parents left is this node that we're

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,920
looking at then let's delete the parents left.

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,330
If the parent's right, obviously if the parent
if it's not the parents left in the parent

21
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,330
exists then it's this must be the parent's
right pointer.

22
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:19,100
So, if the parent's right pointer is this
pointer, then we update that parent's right

23
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,320
pointer to get rid of this node and then we
actually get rid of the node.

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,190
So, in the no children case this is actually
pretty simple.

25
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:30,549
We basically just update the parent’s pointer
so that it points to null and then delete

26
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:30,829
the node.
