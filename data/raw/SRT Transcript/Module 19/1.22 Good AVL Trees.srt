00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,510
Here's an example of a good AVL tree.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,720
So what we did was we did some insertions,
like we inserted the value of ten and we inserted

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,030
five and twenty and three, and those all got
inserted onto the tree.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,190
What we have here is that ten has a height
of two.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,850
Now how we calculated that was by looking
at the height of the left sub child and the

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:25,970
height of the rights sub child, and determining
that the maximum of those two heights is one

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,619
and then adding one to that.

8
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:32,369
So that's why the height of the node at three,
for example, is a zero because the height

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,030
of the left sub child is a negative one and
the height of the right sub child is a negative

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,570
one and we can add one to that, and add one
to the maximum of that which is the same value,

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,899
and we get zero.

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,859
So what we can do is say that this is a good
AVL tree because the height of all of the

13
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:52,479
nodes are, the height of all the left sub
child for every node in the height of all

14
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:58,729
the right sub child for every node, is equal
to a value that differing by only no more

15
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:59,729
than one.

16
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,850
So that the largest difference here is actually
if we get to the root node, if we take a look

17
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:10,920
at the root node, the height of the left sub
child five is one and the height of the right

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,950
sub child is zero, the value twenty.

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,280
We can also look at that node five which has
a height of the left sub child of zero and

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,130
the height of the right sub child as negative
one.

21
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,289
So, that's a difference of only, of only one.

22
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:32,189
So, in no case do we differ from the left
sub child to the right sub child by more than

23
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,900
one and so this is an acceptable AVL tree.
