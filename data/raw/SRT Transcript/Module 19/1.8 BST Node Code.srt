00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,240
I wanted you to see the code here for the
binary search tree node, and this helps us

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,170
a little bit to understand what we're looking
at when we see the binary search trees no

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,900
order when we're talking about the binary
search tree.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,929
What I've got here is just a data element
and it looks very much like we had with the

5
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:19,480
linked lists.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,380
There's just a data element and I have a templated,
so it's a template type T. And then we have

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,999
a pointer to the parent, pointer to the left
sub-child or pointer to the rights sub-child,

8
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:29,050
and that's it.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,079
That's all the storage that the entire BST
node class has.

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,870
I had a constructor in the same way that I
have a constructor for the linked list; it's

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,510
just useful for setting things up and it makes
creation of nodes a little bit easier later

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,510
on.

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,969
I have a friend just like I did in the linked
list, so the very common, a very much common

14
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:50,379
with the linked list here except that we've
got two pointers, a left and right child.

15
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:55,260
We're going to get into this getSize class,
in just a minute of the getSize function in

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,499
just a minute, what it's going to do is just
tell us how many nodes there are as children

17
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:03,420
and this node for the node.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,170
So, we're talking about the size really that's
by definition if you remember back from the

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,810
definitions we did a couple of slides ago,
this is just the size of this individual node.

20
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,980
So this is the format for the BST node class
and you're going to see a lot of commonalities

21
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,690
with the linked list.
