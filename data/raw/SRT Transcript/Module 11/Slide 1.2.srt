This module we're going to look at C++â€™s
pointers and how we can use them to expand

0:00:06.600,0:00:09.470
the capabilities of what we do in terms of
programming.

0:00:09.470,0:00:13.940
And using heap dynamic variables using heap
dynamic arrays.

0:00:13.940,0:00:18.600
We're going to create some very useful code
here and this code is going to be the basis

0:00:18.600,0:00:24.369
for a lot of what we're doing in the future
for both future programming and for data structures.

0:00:24.369,0:00:28.920
It also leads into discussions on operating
systems so this is a rather important topic

0:00:28.920,0:00:33.109
that's a gateway to a lot of other things
in the rest of the semester.
