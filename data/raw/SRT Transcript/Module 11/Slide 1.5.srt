0:00:00.780,0:00:05.770
So we'd like to use these pointers to point
to something and we can do that but we need

0:00:05.770,0:00:08.500
to have some address that we make it point
to.

0:00:08.500,0:00:14.759
In another words we need to find an address
of a variable and take that address and store

0:00:14.759,0:00:20.910
it in the pointer and we can do that by using
what's called the address of operator.

0:00:20.910,0:00:25.840
It's a new operator that we haven't seen before
but if we place it in front of variable that

0:00:25.840,0:00:31.200
we have existing we're going to get back the
address of that variable.

0:00:31.200,0:00:35.999
Now the data type for the address of an integer
the data type for that would be a pointer

0:00:35.999,0:00:39.899
to an integer which is perfect because now
we know how to create pointers.

0:00:39.899,0:00:45.899
So we have a little bit of code here which
is just simply creates a variable called x.

0:00:45.899,0:00:50.800
Sets its value equal to one hundred and then
we have a pointer and the pointer is set to

0:00:50.800,0:00:52.559
point to x.

0:00:52.559,0:00:58.550
Now that allows us to work with the x value
but not use the variable name x which we're

0:00:58.550,0:01:00.620
going to see later on is very important.

0:01:00.620,0:01:07.750
We can use pointer ptr and access x as if
we're accessing it through the pointer which

0:01:07.750,0:01:09.420
is exactly what we're doing.

0:01:09.420,0:01:14.100
But we're going to need to get the address
of x first and we do that using the ampersand

0:01:14.100,0:01:16.459
or what's called the address of operator.
