0:00:00.780,0:00:04.680
So when we first create a pointer just like
when we first create any variable. We don't

0:00:04.680,0:00:09.570
know the value thatâ€™s in it. And that's
a bad thing if we're talking about an integer.

0:00:09.570,0:00:14.419
But it's a really bad thing if we're talking
about a pointer because when we create a pointer

0:00:14.419,0:00:19.580
it has some garbage value it has something
in it it's not zero it's not unknown value.

0:00:19.580,0:00:24.650
It's something and we don't know what that
something is so effectively the pointer is

0:00:24.650,0:00:29.800
now pointing somewhere where we didn't decide
where it's pointing. And if we use that we

0:00:29.800,0:00:33.850
have the potential for crashing our program
or doing horrible horrible things inside the

0:00:33.850,0:00:39.039
computer. So we don't want to do that. So
whenever we create a pointer or whatever we

0:00:39.039,0:00:44.829
have a pointer that's not pointing at something
valid we should make that pointer point to

0:00:44.829,0:00:50.129
a special place. And that special place is
known as NULL or null ptr. It's capital N

0:00:50.129,0:00:56.999
U L L or null ptr all lowercase. But it's
really important that we always make sure

0:00:56.999,0:01:02.260
that the pointer is either pointing at somewhere
valid like a variable or somewhere on the

0:01:02.260,0:01:07.640
heap or it's pointing at NULL or null ptr.
If it's ever pointing somewhere else then

0:01:07.640,0:01:12.579
we're never going to be able to check to see
if it is pointing at something valid because

0:01:12.579,0:01:17.500
some arbitrary location in main memory will
look exactly like a variable on the heap or

0:01:17.500,0:01:21.560
a variable in the stack. There will be no
way to differentiate between something that's

0:01:21.560,0:01:26.350
valid and something that's invalid.
So we use null ptr as a safety mechanism.

0:01:26.350,0:01:30.170
Whenever we have a pointer and it's not pointing
at somewhere that we know we make it point

0:01:30.170,0:01:31.609
to NULL or null ptr.
