0:00:00.820,0:00:03.210
In C++ we have to specify the data type.

0:00:03.210,0:00:07.180
C++ is very type specific so we always have
to specify the data type.

0:00:07.180,0:00:12.639
And a pointer is going to be specified as
pointing to a particular data type.

0:00:12.639,0:00:17.240
So a pointer as we're going to see later on
is really just a number that we store in main

0:00:17.240,0:00:20.679
memory to represent where this pointer is
pointing to.

0:00:20.679,0:00:25.140
It's actually just a memory address but the
problem with this is that all memory addresses

0:00:25.140,0:00:26.539
are the same size.

0:00:26.539,0:00:31.369
Unfortunately C++ doesn't let us take an integer
pointer and make it point to a double you

0:00:31.369,0:00:32.500
can't do that.

0:00:32.500,0:00:36.539
You can't make an integer pointer point to
anything other than an integer.

0:00:36.539,0:00:41.090
So if we took an integer variable and we found
out its address which weâ€™ll figure out how

0:00:41.090,0:00:46.219
to do later on we could take that which is
just simply a number it's an address and we

0:00:46.219,0:00:48.020
could store it in a pointer.

0:00:48.020,0:00:54.489
Now that has the effect of making the pointer
point to the integer and that's exactly how

0:00:54.489,0:00:55.489
we do this.

0:00:55.489,0:00:59.410
The stored number represents the memory address
of the item that we're being that's being

0:00:59.410,0:01:00.740
pointed to.

0:01:00.740,0:01:06.470
We can create pointers using a very simple
construct it's just int star ptr.

0:01:06.470,0:01:11.670
In the same way that we can create integers
like int x we can create integer pointers

0:01:11.670,0:01:15.640
by just saying int star and then giving it
a variable name.

0:01:15.640,0:01:19.830
At that point on construction the pointer
doesn't point to anything reasonable it's

0:01:19.830,0:01:24.890
pointing to garbage in the same way that if
we said int x we don't know the value of x.

0:01:24.890,0:01:28.590
If we say int star ptr we don't know the value
of ptr.

0:01:28.590,0:01:29.450
It's pointing at garbage.
