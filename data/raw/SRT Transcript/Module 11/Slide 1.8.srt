0:00:00.870,0:00:05.950
So there's one little problem with C++ that's
a little bit of almost like an eccentricity

0:00:05.950,0:00:07.850
of C++ it is a little strange.

0:00:07.850,0:00:13.110
If we define multiple pointers on the same
line the star doesn't associate with the data

0:00:13.110,0:00:15.540
type it actually associates with the variable
name.

0:00:15.540,0:00:19.550
And I know this makes absolutely no sense
but if you take a look at this sample code

0:00:19.550,0:00:24.020
you'll see that here we're creating three
pointers and one x one integer.

0:00:24.020,0:00:32.270
So the three pointers need to have their stars
immediately preceding the variable name and

0:00:32.270,0:00:37.649
this actually doesn't even matter if the star
is before the space immediately adjacent to

0:00:37.649,0:00:42.859
the int or if it's to the right and immediately
adjacent to the name of the variable.

0:00:42.859,0:00:49.129
But it's important to recognize that the star
does not make the line create all pointers

0:00:49.129,0:00:51.320
it makes only that variable a pointer.

0:00:51.320,0:00:57.159
So in this case we have ptr one ptr two and
ptr three are pointers to integers.

0:00:57.159,0:00:59.059
But x is just an integer on its own.
