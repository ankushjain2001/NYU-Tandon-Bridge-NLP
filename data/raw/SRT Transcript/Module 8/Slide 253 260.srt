Ok so let's implement a program that solves
the quadratic equation. Let's also focus in

0:00:06.809,0:00:15.320
this implementation not only making this program
work but also breaking it down to functions

0:00:15.320,0:00:22.400
in a correct way so that would increase the
readability over a program and the usability

0:00:22.400,0:00:29.050
of the functionalities we implement. So we
can reuse it in other cases as well. Let's

0:00:29.050,0:00:36.449
also focus on the how to document our code
in this sense as well. So let's start obviously

0:00:36.449,0:00:42.100
we would include iostream cmath we probably
need a square root there so let’s include

0:00:42.100,0:00:49.350
the cmath. Using namespace std and let’s
also define constants for the different types

0:00:49.350,0:00:56.379
of solutions. So let’s add no solutions
one real solution two real solutions all reals

0:00:56.379,0:01:03.739
or no real solution. We’ll have a number
associated to each of them but the name of

0:01:03.739,0:01:10.400
the constant matters the most because we are
going to use the names to kind of speak what

0:01:10.400,0:01:18.700
we want to say. Then we are going to define
a quadratic equation right. I am before we

0:01:18.700,0:01:24.180
start the main we have all of these definitions
the includes the constants the prototypes

0:01:24.180,0:01:31.650
here. So for example for quadratic we have
double A double B D sorry double A double

0:01:31.650,0:01:40.320
B and double C as three inputs all passed
by value. And then quadratic should let’s

0:01:40.320,0:01:48.280
think what quadratic should return. It should
tell us what kind of solutions we have here.

0:01:48.280,0:01:53.900
Either no solution one solution two solutions
and so on that is one thing it should return.

0:01:53.900,0:01:57.940
And it should also tell us what are the solutions
in case we have two real solutions we want

0:01:57.940,0:02:05.180
to know what are the solutions. So we are
expecting somewhere between one value only

0:02:05.180,0:02:14.030
saying what the types of solutions we have
to three. In case there are also some solutions.

0:02:14.030,0:02:19.310
So in case there is no solution at all we’ll
get only one value back. In case there are

0:02:19.310,0:02:27.389
two solutions we’ll get two real solutions
and then two values that are also as the solutions.

0:02:27.389,0:02:33.200
So we are expecting somewhere between one
to three values as a return. I think it makes

0:02:33.200,0:02:41.630
sense to return the type of solution as a
return value and to allow two parameter that

0:02:41.630,0:02:51.409
could be passed by reference to store and
to return in them the two solutions in case

0:02:51.409,0:03:02.460
we have two solutions. For that I made the
return value of type int and two doubles that

0:03:02.460,0:03:10.180
are passed by reference so the quadratic can
update the main’s variables to contain or

0:03:10.180,0:03:20.819
to have the solutions. That seems like a good
prototype a good interface with a quadratic

0:03:20.819,0:03:30.860
function. Let’s also document what we kind
of said over here. So that kind of document

0:03:30.860,0:03:36.641
that describes the interface of with a function
basically what the caller of the function

0:03:36.641,0:03:45.299
should know when it uses when they use this
functions should come right here where we

0:03:45.299,0:03:52.140
define the prototype of the function. So we
said we say first that the quadratic function

0:03:52.140,0:03:59.041
solves the quadratic equation of the form
A x squared plus B x plus C equals zero. We

0:03:59.041,0:04:02.980
should say what the input of the function
is what the output of the function is and

0:04:02.980,0:04:09.980
if there are any assumptions we should also
say that. So the caller would know what assumptions

0:04:09.980,0:04:17.040
this function basically takes. What assumptions
the caller should have or should assume for

0:04:17.040,0:04:26.850
this function behavior. So for inputs obviously
A B and C are the coefficients of the equation.

0:04:26.850,0:04:32.630
For outputs we should say that there are three
kind of outputs even though two of the outputs

0:04:32.630,0:04:38.560
are inside kind of the input location input
position inside the parentheses. They are

0:04:38.560,0:04:45.700
still considered to be output values. So for
output we will say that there is one the type

0:04:45.700,0:04:51.680
of the solution and I also say what mechanism
I am using to return this output that is return

0:04:51.680,0:05:01.560
value. And out x one and out x two are solutions
to the equations these are output parameters

0:05:01.560,0:05:02.060
called by reference.
