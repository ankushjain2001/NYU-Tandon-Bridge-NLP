0:00:00.640,0:00:07.130
Assuming we have this function our quadratic
function would now use this function.

0:00:07.130,0:00:15.630
So in the else clause in case A is equal to
zero then we just call the linear passing

0:00:15.630,0:00:19.710
what would be the inputs for linear?

0:00:19.710,0:00:30.230
So yeah so the quadratic B and C coefficients
become the A and B coefficients for the linear.

0:00:30.230,0:00:43.660
So we’ll pass B and C and then out x one
would be our reference to where we write the

0:00:43.660,0:00:47.540
solution in case there is a solution.

0:00:47.540,0:00:53.871
Maybe I’d note here that we are passing
like out x one is already a reference to a

0:00:53.871,0:00:56.019
variable x one in our main.

0:00:56.019,0:01:03.089
And now we are passing it to another function
by reference so we won’t get a reference

0:01:03.089,0:01:07.560
to the reference that would give us a reference
to the original value in the main.

0:01:07.560,0:01:15.780
So when linear updates out x one it basically
updates the original reference we’ve passed

0:01:15.780,0:01:17.200
from the main.

0:01:17.200,0:01:26.490
So yeah so we’re passing out x one and basically
we are just rolling out the return value of

0:01:26.490,0:01:29.120
linear as the return value of quadratic.

0:01:29.120,0:01:35.330
So if linear returns no solution or one real
solution or all reals we’ll just keep on

0:01:35.330,0:01:37.960
returning it as a return value of quadratic.

0:01:37.960,0:01:40.539
That’s why we are saying return linear.
