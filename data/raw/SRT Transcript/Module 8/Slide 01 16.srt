Hi there hope you are having a great day.
Today we are going to talk about functions.

0:00:05.430,0:00:12.870
Let’s start by first calculating the k combinations.
Now let’s start with the definition what

0:00:12.870,0:00:21.000
are k combinations. So let n and k be two
integers non negative integers. And let’s

0:00:21.000,0:00:29.830
assume that k is not greater than n namely
k is less or equal to n. So the k combinations

0:00:29.830,0:00:38.179
are the number of unsorted selections of distinct
elements from a set of elements. So assuming

0:00:38.179,0:00:46.249
you have n elements in how many ways can you
take k elements out of that. For example if

0:00:46.249,0:00:55.569
n is five and k is three what are three combinations
that case. So assuming you have a set of n

0:00:55.569,0:01:05.460
elements in this case five balls a green one
orange purple blue and red. Let’s see in

0:01:05.460,0:01:13.189
how many ways can we select three balls out
of these five balls. So the first one can

0:01:13.189,0:01:22.030
be I don’t know take a blue purple and a
green. So they aren’t ordered it means that

0:01:22.030,0:01:26.541
there is no difference between blue purple
and green and green purple and blue. It is

0:01:26.541,0:01:34.210
the same it is choosing these three balls.
And that’s another way. And there are no

0:01:34.210,0:01:41.189
duplicates here. So we can’t choose two
purples or something like that. So we can

0:01:41.189,0:01:48.020
do it this way that way we can do it in a
lot of ways. The number of ways we can choose

0:01:48.020,0:01:56.289
three balls out of these n out of these five
are called three combinations. So we would

0:01:56.289,0:02:04.369
like to figure out what are three combinations
from a set of five. Luckily for us by the

0:02:04.369,0:02:12.900
way it is also noted as n choose three that’s
another way to call it. And we can write it

0:02:12.900,0:02:21.819
as like this big parentheses and then you
have a n and a k under it. Luckily for us

0:02:21.819,0:02:30.569
there is a theorem that tells us the value
of n choose k. So let n and k be two non negative

0:02:30.569,0:02:38.590
integers such that k is not greater than n.
The number of k combinations of a set of n

0:02:38.590,0:02:45.650
elements equals to n choose k that equals
to the factorial of n over the factorial of

0:02:45.650,0:02:53.319
k times the factorial of n minus k. In our
example five choose three or three combinations

0:02:53.319,0:02:59.000
would be the factorial of five over the factorial
of three times the factorial of two. Basically

0:02:59.000,0:03:07.909
the factorial of five is one twenty over factorial
of three is six times two that is one twenty

0:03:07.909,0:03:10.099
over twelve and that is ten.
