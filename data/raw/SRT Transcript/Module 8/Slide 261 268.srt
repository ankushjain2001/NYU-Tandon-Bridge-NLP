0:00:00.550,0:00:07.160
Let’s go ahead and implement the main. Now
that we’ve declared a function. Again in

0:00:07.160,0:00:16.270
terms of documentation I am just describing
what this program is supposed to do what input

0:00:16.270,0:00:21.039
and output what kind of interaction this program
would have with the user. So I am saying this

0:00:21.039,0:00:27.149
program solved the quadratic equation input
from user would be three real numbers representing

0:00:27.149,0:00:31.909
coefficients of a quadratic equation. And
the output to the user would be the solution

0:00:31.909,0:00:38.789
to the equation if there are any or an appropriate
message. The implementation of main is quite

0:00:38.789,0:00:44.780
straight forward we’ll define A B and C
as local variables. We’ll ask the user to

0:00:44.780,0:00:52.010
enter the coefficients of the quadratic equation
read it into these A B and C. And then we

0:00:52.010,0:01:02.199
should call the quadratic function and figure
out what type of equation we have here what

0:01:02.199,0:01:11.840
kind of solutions we have and this kind of
thing here. In this case so yeah we should

0:01:11.840,0:01:19.270
start with announcing that the equation A
x squared plus B x plus C equals zero has

0:01:19.270,0:01:28.220
and then in this case I think the control
flow that would basically branch between or

0:01:28.220,0:01:35.820
choose between the different types of solutions
is best implemented using a switch statement.

0:01:35.820,0:01:46.080
So we’ll do switch and the value we are
switching over is basically whatever results

0:01:46.080,0:01:51.790
with the call of quadratic. Basically the
return value of quadratic. We said if you

0:01:51.790,0:01:58.030
recall the return value that quadratic returns
is one of the constants up there. The type

0:01:58.030,0:02:04.480
of the solution right. So when we are calling
quadratic with A B C x one and x two which

0:02:04.480,0:02:13.780
are by the way two local variables that we
defined here to store the optional solutions.

0:02:13.780,0:02:19.590
But when we are switching over the call of
quadratic basically the value of this call

0:02:19.590,0:02:25.950
would be the return value. And that is the
type of solutions. So we’ll have a case

0:02:25.950,0:02:31.950
for each type of solution. So we’ll have
case two real solutions case one real solution

0:02:31.950,0:02:37.940
case no real solution case no solutions at
all and case no reals. And we will also have

0:02:37.940,0:02:42.400
like a default clause saying that there is
an error because we are expecting to get one

0:02:42.400,0:02:49.620
of them. So I hope you are convinced now that
a switch makes it very readable. So we are

0:02:49.620,0:02:56.980
switching over the call of quadratic and the
different cases are basically the different

0:02:56.980,0:03:02.790
kinds of solutions. Again the use of constants
here makes our code very readable. We can

0:03:02.790,0:03:08.760
basically see switch quadratic and case two
real solution one real solution the different

0:03:08.760,0:03:14.320
cases. And let’s see how we behave in each
one of these cases. So in case of two real

0:03:14.320,0:03:21.020
solutions we just print the solutions are
x one space x two right we said that in case

0:03:21.020,0:03:26.680
there are solutions we want them updated in
the output parameters. In this case x one

0:03:26.680,0:03:35.380
and x two would contain these values. One
real solution let’s print one solution and

0:03:35.380,0:03:42.819
then x one by the way how do we know that
the solution is inside the x one? That’s

0:03:42.819,0:03:49.430
a thing we should maybe say a few words about
it. No real solution by the way we just print

0:03:49.430,0:03:54.930
no real solution or no solution at all or
that all the real numbers are solutions.
