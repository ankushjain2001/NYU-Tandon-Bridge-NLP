0:00:00.599,0:00:07.319
But let’s add an assumption as we said to
say that what’s the behavior in case there

0:00:07.319,0:00:09.520
aren’t just two real solutions.

0:00:09.520,0:00:12.150
So let’s add these two assumptions.

0:00:12.150,0:00:18.180
We’ll write these assumptions right here
in documentation so the user would know what

0:00:18.180,0:00:20.640
kind of behavior to expect from the function.

0:00:20.640,0:00:28.540
So the assumptions we are adding is if equation
has one solution it would show in out x one.

0:00:28.540,0:00:35.239
So when we in the main said that in case of
one real solution we are printing x one we

0:00:35.239,0:00:42.170
can be we can feel safe that x one would be
the variable that would contain that single

0:00:42.170,0:00:43.449
solution.

0:00:43.449,0:00:50.269
Also we are saying that in case there if equation
has no real solutions or no solutions at all

0:00:50.269,0:00:55.920
the values of the output parameters are not
defined.

0:00:55.920,0:00:57.949
So we don’t care what they have.

0:00:57.949,0:01:05.869
And again in our main when there weren’t
no solutions we didn’t access these output

0:01:05.869,0:01:06.869
parameters.

0:01:06.869,0:01:14.100
So by adding these assumptions to our documentation
we basically tell our caller what type of

0:01:14.100,0:01:19.689
behavior they should expect from our function
to when they use it.
