00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,390
So, what happens if you want to do both reading
and writing, and I mentioned this before but

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,430
it's bears repeating.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,950
Surprisingly, it's actually strange to want
to do both reading and writing at the same

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,130
time. and I know the concept that you have
in mind is one of like well what if I open

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,349
up a document in word and I want to edit that
document.

6
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:23,789
Well, what word actually does is read in the
entire file; itâ€™ll read in your Word document

7
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,610
into main memory and when you make any changes
you're not making them in the file, you're

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,489
making them in main memory.

9
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:34,649
And anybody who's forgotten to save the file
knows exactly what I'm talking about because

10
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,829
when you go back if you hadn't saved it, it
won't remember any of those changes that you

11
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:39,829
made.

12
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:43,710
So what's happening is we're reading in the
file making the changes in memory and we're

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,160
writing back over the same file.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,720
Which is useful because if we want to save
the information out we can either save it

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,360
out to the same file or we can save it out
to a different file altogether.

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,530
Now usually we'll read in that entire file,
will make those changes in memory and then

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,930
we'll write the file out to the disk and that's
a normal process to do; that means we're not

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,860
going to be doing both reading and writing
at the same time.

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:15,000
So what you would see is the opening of an
input file, the complete reading in operation

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,880
of the input file, and then calling close
on that input file.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,280
Then we would do whatever changes are as necessary,
open the output file with the same file name,

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,390
write everything out and then close the output
file.

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,030
So that's really the process for doing both
reading and writing; in other words, in place

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,180
modification of the files is not a normal
thing to do.
