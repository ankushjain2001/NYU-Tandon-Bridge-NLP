1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,820
Cin and Cout are also objects.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,049
We've been working with them over the past
few weeks and we didn't realize that they

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,660
are actually also objects and their data type
is an ifstream and an ofstream.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,920
Now since we understand inheritance, we know
that an ifstream object is actually an istream

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,420
object as it's base class.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,750
Every ifstream can be treated as if it were
an istream, and every ofstream can be treated

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,460
as if it were an ostream object or said another
way, if we design a function to accept istream

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,820
and ostream by reference of course objects
then we can also accept ifstream and ofstream

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,820
objects.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,839
Which is a really nice convenient way of saying
that we can create a function that can accept

11
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:52,769
either a file or it can accept the screen
or keyboard for input and output.

12
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:58,769
And that's very helpful for debugging purposes
if we create a function to do all the processing,

13
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:04,710
to do all the output or all the input, and
then allow for debugging to send either Cout

14
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,189
or Cin to that function.
