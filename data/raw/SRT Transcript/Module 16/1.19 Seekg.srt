1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,220
There's another function inside the stream
object which is useful, called seekG.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,740
And seekG allows us to move the file pointer
around skipping over characters either forwards

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,990
or backwards.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,070
We can also use seekG to move back to the
beginning of the file.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,480
So, if we specify a positive number that moves
us that number of characters ahead in the

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
file.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,330
If we specify a negative number that takes
us back that number of characters, but if

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,439
we specify as zero takes us back to the beginning
of the file.

9
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,640
Now one of the things to take care of here
it with seekG is that if we've reached the

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,580
E.O.F. marker, if weâ€™ve reached the end
of file and the file is now what we consider

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,680
in a failed state because we read in the end
of file marker, using seekG to send it back

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,530
to zero doesn't clear those flags.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,460
So if what your point is, is get once you're
at the end of the file is to move it back

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,879
to the beginning of the file, make sure you
call it clear because it's going to clear

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,260
those flags also.
