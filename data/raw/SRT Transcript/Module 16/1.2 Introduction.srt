1
00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:05,379
In this model we're going to start working
with files on the file system as input into

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,430
our programs.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,340
We're going to use these files to bring in
data into our program and then we're also

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,269
going to use files to store information after
we're done with it.

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,660
So this whole module is about bringing in
information and sending it out to the file

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,069
system for permanent storage.
