1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,909
To get this to work, first you have to include
fstream.

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:07,559
So we put at the top of any program that we're
going to use files we're going to put pounding

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,299
include fstream as you have seen it here.

4
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:16,970
Once we've done that, we have the ability
to create those objects of type ifstream and

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,650
ofstream which is appropriate to the action
that we're going to perform.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,599
And then we have to open the connection to
the file in the file system.

7
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,880
So it's not enough to just create the object,
we have to actually connect that object to

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,730
the file in the file system.

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,800
Now be very cautious, because opening a file
could fail.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,940
There's a lot of situations which could cause
either an output or an input file to fail

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,420
so it's really important that we check that
with an if statement after we've made the

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,880
attempt to open the file.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,170
Once the files open the object can be used
for import now put in really the same way

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,570
that we've been using the cin and the cout
variables.

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,590
We can use the output operator and the input
operator appropriately for whatever the data

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,109
type is we're working with, whether we're
doing input or output.

17
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:05,140
And in reality it works very much the same
way.
