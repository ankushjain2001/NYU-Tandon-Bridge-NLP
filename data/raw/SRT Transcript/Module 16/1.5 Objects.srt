1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,210
So C++ has an internal representation object
for the files.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,880
So there's an object inside C++ which represents
our connection to the file.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,530
The data type of that is going to differ based
on what we're going to do with it; whether

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,540
it's an input file or an output file.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,680
And if we want to have an input file, then
the object type that we have to create is

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,400
called an ifstream.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,180
And if we want to have an output file, then
the object type we have to create is an ofstream.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:34,949
So it's fairly easy to remember these as fstream
objects, and the i is an input file stream

9
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:39,649
and the o is an output file stream so ifstream
or ofstream.

10
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,239
You have to create the appropriate type and
you can't change what you're going to do with

11
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:45,059
that file once it's created.

12
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,859
But of course you could always close it and
open it is a different type.
