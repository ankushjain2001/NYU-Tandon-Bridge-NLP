1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,270
So let's try to think how we can solve this
problem.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:13,010
First, most basic idea would say do the same
thing as we've done before, basically searching

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,260
the array element by element.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:21,770
So let's see what the first value of the array
is, in this case it is one.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,060
So, we're searching, for example val equals
seventy nine, so it's not one.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,810
Let's go over to the next one three; that's
not seventy nine.

7
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,370
It's go over for the next one, four that's
not seventy nine.

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,710
Once again eight; that's not seventy nine
and so on.

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:42,050
We can continue on iterating over the elements
with an array.

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:49,550
Yeah, basically could work, once again the
running time of this approach would be linear

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:55,940
because we'll worst case have to iterate over
the entire range of elements, basically Taito

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,940
of N.

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,560
But this approach here doesn't take advantage
of the fact that our array is given to us,

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,590
basically, in an increasing order and we can
take advantage of that if we do something

15
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,780
a bit differently.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,020
So, for example if we’re again searching
for seventy nine.

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:22,030
Let's take a look at the entire range and
look only at the element that appears in the

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,020
middle of the array.

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,480
Let's test that element for its value.

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,090
for example, this element could be ninety
six; since we know we're searching for seventy

21
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:41,740
nine and at the middle there is ninety six,
we don't really have to go over the entire

22
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,290
left side of the array right because after
all on the left side of ninety six would appear

23
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,020
only values that are greater than ninety six.

24
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:57,420
So, just by looking at ninety six, we can
rule out all the greater part there or the

25
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:05,470
left part of ninety six and keeping us with
only the smaller values smaller than ninety

26
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,600
six to look for seventy nine.

27
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,760
So, with one check we basically ruled out
half of our range.

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,900
And then once again for the half of the numbers
we still have to search for; again we can

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:27,069
look at only the middle point of that range,
testing the value of the element that is there.

30
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,439
For example, twenty eight and then once again
since we're looking for seventy nine the numbers

31
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:37,370
are in an increasing order, if we know that
in some position there is twenty eight we

32
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,559
can rule out all the elements there are smaller
than twenty eight; we can basically rule out

33
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:50,079
all of these elements and keeping us with
only the range of elements between these twenty

34
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,440
eight and ninety six.

35
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,010
Once again, we can check what's in the middle
of that range; for example, eighty four and

36
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,379
we can rule out all the elements that are
greater than eighty four.

37
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:08,540
We can, we’re then left with the inner range
over there looking at the middle point and

38
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,569
luckily seventy nine; so we've just found
our seventy one.

39
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:18,969
So, basically we are starting with the regional
range, and each time we're ruling out, we're

40
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:24,409
taking off half of the elements, basically
closing on the element we are searching for.

41
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:27,839
Let's try to implement this approach on the
computer.
