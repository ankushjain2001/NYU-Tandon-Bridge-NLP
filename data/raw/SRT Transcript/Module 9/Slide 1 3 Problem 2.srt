0:00:00.780,0:00:01.780
Okay.

0:00:01.780,0:00:09.360
So now let's try to make this program a bit
more complicated: in addition to just calculating

0:00:09.360,0:00:16.049
the average, let's also figure out which grades
are above the average.So, the program would

0:00:16.049,0:00:17.300
interact something like that.

0:00:17.300,0:00:22.100
First it would ask the user to enter the number
of students in the class, the student would

0:00:22.100,0:00:23.350
say four.

0:00:23.350,0:00:27.430
Again, the user would be asked to enter the
grades.

0:00:27.430,0:00:33.829
So seventy one, eighty six, sixty eight, ninety
four, and then the program would not only

0:00:33.829,0:00:37.739
say that the average is seventy nine point
seven five.

0:00:37.739,0:00:44.899
It would also say that the grades above the
average are: eighty six and ninety four.

0:00:44.899,0:00:52.629
Seems very similar, but then if we think about
it a bit more; let's see how we can implement

0:00:52.629,0:00:55.039
this requirement.

0:00:55.039,0:01:03.230
So, we would need to know what grades are
above the average.

0:01:03.230,0:01:10.430
We can do it really in a single pass over
the elements, just as we have for calculating

0:01:10.430,0:01:15.570
the average when we wanted to sum them up
because only after figuring out the value

0:01:15.570,0:01:19.720
of the average we can know which grades are
above the average.

0:01:19.720,0:01:26.310
So it seems like we would need two passes
over the data in order to find the grade that

0:01:26.310,0:01:29.450
are above the average.

0:01:29.450,0:01:35.570
So one solution could be letâ€™s ask the user
to re-enter the grades after we calculated

0:01:35.570,0:01:41.869
the average but that is not user friendly
at all.

0:01:41.869,0:01:49.630
And so, another solution could be maybe to
store the grades, to store these datas in

0:01:49.630,0:01:55.590
our memory, so we can pass over them more
than once.

0:01:55.590,0:02:01.330
It could be very impractical to store them
in different variables because first, we don't

0:02:01.330,0:02:06.890
know how many variables we would need and
it would be very difficult to manage these

0:02:06.890,0:02:07.890
variables.

0:02:07.890,0:02:12.670
For that we would need some kind of a data
structure, which is a single entity that allows

0:02:12.670,0:02:19.370
us to store a collection of elements in it
and to access and modify these elements as

0:02:19.370,0:02:21.280
we need.

0:02:21.280,0:02:28.790
We would use the ray data structure, a static
array basically, which can be thought of as

0:02:28.790,0:02:36.390
a sequence of variables that are of the same
type; in this case are integers.

0:02:36.390,0:02:37.819
Let's see how it works.
