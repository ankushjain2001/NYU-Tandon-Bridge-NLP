0:00:00.640,0:00:01.640
Okay.

0:00:01.640,0:00:08.360
So now we have our sum variable, we set it
to zero and we start iterating over the array.

0:00:08.360,0:00:14.340
We first add seventy one into sum, that would
make it seventy one, then our index would

0:00:14.340,0:00:15.340
be two.

0:00:15.340,0:00:20.199
I'm not changing the index value but the index
is going to change again, zero, one, two,

0:00:20.199,0:00:22.669
three, four, as we iterate over the array.

0:00:22.669,0:00:28.490
So, a second iteration index is one, we’re
adding eighty six to our sum, that would make

0:00:28.490,0:00:30.829
it one fifty seven.

0:00:30.829,0:00:37.609
Then we're adding the sixty eight, it would
make sum two twenty five and eventually we'll

0:00:37.609,0:00:42.940
add ninety four that would make sum be three
nineteen, I think.

0:00:42.940,0:00:50.199
Then we have our average variable and average
is three nineteen divided by four, which is

0:00:50.199,0:00:53.199
a seventy nine point seven five.

0:00:53.199,0:00:55.629
We just print this value as the average.

0:00:55.629,0:01:02.210
Now, we’ll need to make another path over
the numbers in order to figure out which ones

0:01:02.210,0:01:03.210
are above the average.

0:01:03.210,0:01:04.339
Let’s go and do that.
