Hi there.

0:00:01.750,0:00:02.780
I hope you're okay.

0:00:02.780,0:00:08.410
Today we're going to talk about our first
data structure in simplest loss.

0:00:08.410,0:00:13.790
But before we start doing that, let's take
a second look at one of our programs we've

0:00:13.790,0:00:17.420
implemented in one of the previous models.

0:00:21.650,0:00:27.010
But I hope you recall that we calculated an
average of a sequence of elements.

0:00:27.010,0:00:33.390
Actually, we wrote a program that computes
the average of student grades.

0:00:33.390,0:00:38.440
The program first asks the user to enter how
many grades.

0:00:38.440,0:00:43.860
How many students are in the class of the
student, the user responded; letâ€™s say four.

0:00:43.860,0:00:49.399
And then he was asked to enter the grades
one after the other, so seventy one, eighty

0:00:49.399,0:00:54.830
six, sixty nine, ninety four, and eventually
the program just responded with the average

0:00:54.830,0:00:59.000
of these grades, which is seventy nine point
twenty five.

0:00:59.000,0:01:07.290
So, if you recall when we implemented this
program we basically summed up all the numbers

0:01:07.290,0:01:12.170
and divided it by the amount of the numbers,
that's how we calculate the average.

0:01:12.170,0:01:14.220
Let's take a closer look at our implementation.
