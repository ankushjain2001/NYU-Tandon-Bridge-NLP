0:00:00.140,0:00:01.150
Okay then.

0:00:01.150,0:00:06.500
Now let's make one more pass over the data
in order to print the ones that are above

0:00:06.500,0:00:07.500
the average.

0:00:07.500,0:00:14.020
Let's first start with announcing to the user
that ‘the grades above the average are’

0:00:14.020,0:00:17.279
and now let's start iterating over our array.

0:00:17.279,0:00:23.570
So once again, we'll have our index starting
at zero, incremented each iteration and it

0:00:23.570,0:00:28.810
goes as long as its value is less than number
of students.

0:00:28.810,0:00:35.039
And now we have to figure out if we want to
print this current element or not, so we'll

0:00:35.039,0:00:41.420
just if the grades list, our current element,
grades list ind that's the element we're currently

0:00:41.420,0:00:47.550
looking at, is as we asked it to be above
the average, so greater than the value of

0:00:47.550,0:00:48.579
the average.

0:00:48.579,0:00:54.420
Then, let's just print this current element:
cout grades list.

0:00:54.420,0:00:57.420
And let's also space after each print.

0:00:57.420,0:01:03.789
Yeah, so that should go over the entire set
of elements and print only the ones that are

0:01:03.789,0:01:06.380
above the average, spacing them.

0:01:06.380,0:01:12.200
After we do all of that, let’s just break
the line so cout endl, and that should be

0:01:12.200,0:01:13.200
it.

0:01:13.200,0:01:15.960
So we have our first iteration to read the
grades.

0:01:15.960,0:01:21.200
Second pass, in order to calculate the average
and eventually, last pass over the elements

0:01:21.200,0:01:24.020
in order to print the ones that are above
the average.

0:01:24.020,0:01:28.180
Let's just execute it, make sure it all behaves
as we expect it to.

0:01:28.180,0:01:29.990
Build success succeeded.

0:01:29.990,0:01:32.229
Please enter a number of students.

0:01:32.229,0:01:33.500
That would be four.

0:01:33.500,0:01:36.619
Oh, we didn't ask the user to enter the grades.

0:01:36.619,0:01:40.649
We'll fix it in the second; it’s now waiting
for the grades.

0:01:40.649,0:01:46.149
So let's have seventy one, eighty six, sixty
eight, ninety four.

0:01:46.149,0:01:50.580
And then, it just says that the class average
is seventy nine seventy five, and the grades

0:01:50.580,0:01:54.050
above the average are eighty six and ninety
four which is great.

0:01:54.050,0:01:58.240
Let's just add this message here before starting
to read the grades.

0:01:58.240,0:02:06.510
Let's ask the user enter the students’ grades,
separated by a space.

0:02:06.510,0:02:08.759
I think that should do it.

0:02:08.759,0:02:10.240
Let’s test it.

0:02:10.240,0:02:11.240
Okay.

0:02:11.240,0:02:12.240
Building.

0:02:12.240,0:02:13.240
Number of students is four.

0:02:13.240,0:02:20.010
Here is our message so let's put seventy one,
eighty six, sixty eight, ninety four, and

0:02:20.010,0:02:25.099
so the average is, again, seventy nine seventy
five and we also have the numbers that are

0:02:25.099,0:02:26.099
above the average.

0:02:26.099,0:02:26.599
Great.
