Let's recap the three basic properties of
arrays.

0:00:05.620,0:00:11.440
So let's say we have an array, so the first
thing is obviously that the elements are all

0:00:11.440,0:00:14.840
stored one after the other in our memory.

0:00:14.840,0:00:20.060
So, the elements are stored continuously in
the memory.

0:00:20.060,0:00:23.949
Second thing is that all of the elements are
of the same type.

0:00:23.949,0:00:29.259
For instance, if they're ints, they're all
going to be four bytes long but they all must

0:00:29.259,0:00:34.410
be of the same type; we can't have an array
that one element is an integer, the other

0:00:34.410,0:00:36.370
is a double and so on.

0:00:36.370,0:00:40.739
So either all of the elements are integers,
or all the elements are doubles, or all the

0:00:40.739,0:00:44.610
elements are chars or whatever, but they all
must be of the same type.

0:00:44.610,0:00:52.739
And the last thing is that we access our array
using a zero-based index system so they have

0:00:52.739,0:00:57.780
their local addresses starting at zero, one,
two, three, and so on.
