0:00:00.520,0:00:01.520
Okay.

0:00:01.520,0:00:08.570
So now that we have the syntax of the arrays
in C++, let’s go back to the problem of

0:00:08.570,0:00:11.610
calculating the grades that are above the
average.

0:00:11.610,0:00:18.980
So, as you recall, we have our class with
four students, we have the grades, and we

0:00:18.980,0:00:25.789
know that, not only, that the average is 79.75,
we also know which grades come about the average.

0:00:25.789,0:00:32.180
In order to implement that, we would obviously
store the grades in an array, but if you recall

0:00:32.180,0:00:36.750
we have to provide the physical size of the
array at compile time.

0:00:36.750,0:00:41.660
So, when we write the code, basically we have
to know how many grades, or what the maximum

0:00:41.660,0:00:43.920
amount of grades we’re gonna have.

0:00:43.920,0:00:49.320
Think it would be a very legitimate assumption
to assume that a class won’t exceed, let’s

0:00:49.320,0:00:51.260
say, sixty students.

0:00:51.260,0:00:56.829
So, let’s update a bit this problem.

0:00:56.829,0:01:03.160
And the program first would ask the user to
enter the number of students and the grades,

0:01:03.160,0:01:05.590
saying not more than sixty.

0:01:05.590,0:01:08.189
And then continue as we said before.

0:01:08.189,0:01:09.159
Let’s go implement it.
