Okay, so let's calculate the average.

0:00:02.740,0:00:08.010
For that we would need to go over the elements
in the array and to sum them up.

0:00:08.010,0:00:09.670
Let's create a sum variable.

0:00:09.670,0:00:16.780
We'll start by setting it to zero and then
iterate over the elements and add each of

0:00:16.780,0:00:20.080
them into sum, so we'll use a for loop.

0:00:20.080,0:00:29.720
Again index would start zero, it would increase
each iteration and we just keep on going while

0:00:29.720,0:00:32.230
ind is less than number of students.

0:00:32.230,0:00:40.420
So this basically is the way we pass over
an array; we start our index with zero, we

0:00:40.420,0:00:46.120
move it, increase each iteration and go up
to the logical size of that array.

0:00:46.120,0:00:53.610
Each time here we just want to add the current
element into sum, so sum plus equals, lets

0:00:53.610,0:00:58.829
access our grades list at the index position.

0:00:58.829,0:01:05.869
This code here will then just add all the
elements in the array up into are some variable.

0:01:05.869,0:01:08.729
After doing that we can calculate the average.

0:01:08.729,0:01:15.819
So let's have a double variable; let's call
it average and we can just set the average

0:01:15.819,0:01:20.240
to be sum divided by the number of students.

0:01:20.240,0:01:26.569
One thing we should be careful though is when
we divide sum and num of students, since they

0:01:26.569,0:01:31.850
are both integers this division is basically
integer division; it’s div.

0:01:31.850,0:01:36.759
So, we should cast sum and number of students
in order to turn it into real division.

0:01:36.759,0:01:43.509
So let's cast some to a double and number
of students to a double and then this would

0:01:43.509,0:01:46.320
be real division and not just integer division.

0:01:46.320,0:01:53.499
So after we have the average calculated, we
can output to the user that ‘the class average

0:01:53.499,0:01:59.810
is’ and then just print the value of the
variable average; that basically calculate

0:01:59.810,0:02:01.009
the average here.

0:02:01.009,0:02:03.629
Let's try to trace this, see if it all makes
sense.
