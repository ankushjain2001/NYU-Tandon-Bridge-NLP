00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,360
Let's get down to the syntax of how we can
create a class.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,620
First off the class is an abstract data type,
so we're creating a new data type for C++

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,100
to know about.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:15,860
We can create this class as a data type which
is a more complex data type made up of simpler

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,860
data types.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,450
And we're going to get into this a lot because
we can make them very, very complex.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,410
Of course we’ll use the C++ keyword class,
which means incidentally that you can never

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,110
use the word class as an identifier for anything
inside your programs.

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,610
You can't create a variable named class.

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:39,550
Here's a quick view of what a date class might
look at, and we know that a date is actually

11
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,810
just three integers; it's a day, a month,
and a year.

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:48,440
So here we’re creating a new data type for
the storage of three integers, atomically,

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,100
so that they go together.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,930
The year and the month and the day are all
associated, so that for example, your birthday

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,219
is actually three different numbers associated
with them one another: the day, the month,

16
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,260
and the year.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,009
And we need to have all three contain together;
hence the idea of encapsulation.
