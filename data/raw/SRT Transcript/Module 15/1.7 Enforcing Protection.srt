00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,719
The previous code we looked at was a really
simplistic view of a class.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,460
And the problem with the simplistic view of
a class is that it's storing three integers,

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,259
and integers, the domain of an integer is
negative two point one billion to positive

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,639
two point one billion.

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,670
Now I don't know what it means if the day
is negative two point one billion or the day

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,849
is positive three hundred thousand, it really
doesn't make sense because in our model in

7
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:29,830
our world, the day can't be a number outside
the range of one to thirty one.

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,140
So rather than allowing uncontrolled or what
we call public access previously, we should

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,530
really protect that data and we should mark
the data as being private.

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,649
Now one thing to note is that if we leave
off the notation of private or public, then

11
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,710
by default C++ assumes that what we want is
private.

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,129
So we can modify the class now to change that
public keyword to be a private keyword.

13
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:03,430
And now nobody outside of the date class,
can access day, month, or year.

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,040
And that means change it print it do anything
with it; nobody has access to those three

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,630
variables.
