00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:07,360
So first it helps to define what the termâ€™s
class and object are. and for our class we

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,580
consider that a framework which is used to
build multiple objects which are similar.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,770
So for example you might think of a blueprint
for a house as a class.

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,720
The idea is it's the framework that we're
going to build the object around; it tells

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,359
us everything about what's going to be inside
the class but it doesn't tell us what the

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,129
values of the data are for example.

7
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:36,680
The object is just an instance of a class;
it's a class instantiated.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,450
So when we create one of these variables,
we have an object and for that.

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,500
I'll use the example of a house or a cookie,
so going back to our previous examples of

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,530
the blueprint for the house with a cookie
cutter for baking.

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:56,260
We can talk about the object being the House
or the cookie and of course we don't try and

12
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,090
live in the blueprint, we want to live in
the house and if we don't want to eat the

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,810
cookie cutter, because it doesn't taste very
good, we'd rather eat the cookie.
