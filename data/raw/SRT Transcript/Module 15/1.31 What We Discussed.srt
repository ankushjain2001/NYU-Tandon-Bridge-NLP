1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,640
We went over a lot in this module; and I know
it's like drinking from a fire hose right

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640
now.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,940
But we did talk about the definition of the
object in class; we talked about the whole

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,030
concept of encapsulation.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,630
We talked about creation of a class and the
enforcement of protections on the class.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,040
We talked about accessors and mutators, and
the const modifier.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,540
We talked about constructors and how to guarantee
that they were constructed properly.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,300
We talked about using operators on classes
and we talked about classes that contain dynamic

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,200
memory, and then we went into inheritance
and polymorphism.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,060
There's a lot having to do with object orientation
and the amount that you have to capture for

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:44,210
this module is really significant, but once
you kind of get your head around the whole

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:50,380
idea that we're working with data and the
functions to work on that data as a single

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,510
entity, it really starts to become a little
bit obvious.

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,620
So I hope you are able to follow along with
it and if not e-mail us with any questions.

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,110
Thanks.
