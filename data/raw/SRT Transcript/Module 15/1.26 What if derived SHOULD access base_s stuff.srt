1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:05,529
From time to time, there's going to be situations,
of course, where we have to have allowance

2
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:10,290
for the derived class to access the base classes’
private member variables.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,749
And we can't make them private in that case;
so there's no friend possibility here.

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:19,840
But what sequels post does create is something
called protected.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,330
The protected modifier is added, now we now
have public, private, and protected.

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:32,680
Protected is specifically for this purpose:
it allows a derived member function to access

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,360
a base class’s protected information.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,180
But it doesn't allow any access outside of
those two classes: outside of the base class

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,600
or the derived class.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,460
So if we're inside main protected in private
or fact of the same thing but if we're inside

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,020
a derived class we would not have access to
the private information, whereas we would

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,340
have access to the protected information.

13
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:00,010
It doesn't change anything Internal to the
class; so it's only in the case of inheritance

14
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,680
that protected becomes useful because that's
when the derived class would exist.

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,950
And it would have access to those items marked
as protected inside the base class.
