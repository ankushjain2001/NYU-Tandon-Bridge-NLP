00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:03,310
So we can create objects just like any other
data type.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:09,299
it's now a new data type that we have access
to and we can create and we can use.

3
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:13,559
Working with an object requires the use of
the dot operator, and you may have seen this

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,710
before in your work with structs but here
it's much more common to use it.

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,200
Remember that we're not going to have any
access to the private information, but for

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,960
example if we want to set the day, the month,
and the year, we can have this code to show

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:36,410
you how to set a date to for example the sixth,
set the month to August, set the year to one

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,390
nine hundred ninety one and then print out
the fact that this is a very important date.

9
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,930
And if you're interested, google that and
see what date it is.
