1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:07,540
Ok so we have a program that can be executed
by the computer.

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:14,520
It looks as a sequence of zeroes and ones
that represent instructions for the CPU to

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,520
execute.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:23,279
These instructions are very low level they
can add things multiply move data from one

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,359
place to another jump to another position.

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,710
Very simple set of instructions.

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,390
We are not going to program with zeroes and
ones.

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,060
This kind of programming language is called
machine language that is obviously understood

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,100
by the machine by the CPU by a computer.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:50,710
We are going to program and write and implement
our algorithms using a high level language.

11
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,530
There are a lot of high level languages we
are going to write in C++ but there are also

12
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:07,600
Java Python C# and C and Pascal and Scheme
and a lot of high level languages.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,490
A program let’s say in C++ would not look
as a sequence of zeroes and ones it would

14
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,010
look more like that.

15
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:24,170
Which is a text in English contains the English
alphabet you can see we don’t understand

16
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:31,010
exactly what it does but you can see it has
a text Hello World it has some English words

17
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:38,570
you can probably recognize like main and include
and return and stuff like that.

18
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:46,450
So we write in something that is much closer
to our natural language not zeroes and ones.

19
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,340
But then the computer doesn’t understand
this type of language.

20
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,320
So we need to translate this code here into
a machine language code.

21
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:05,440
This kind of translation or this process of
translating a high level language into language

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:13,760
the machine the computer can understand is
called compilation or a build process and

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,250
we lucky for us it is an automated process
since even high level languages are very strict

24
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,980
and we have to follow the rules accurately.

25
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,880
And automated process can just take the code
in the programming language and translate

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,500
it into machine language.

27
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,780
So we just have to start this process and
then our computer will be able to execute

28
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,760
the program we write in the high level language.

29
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,400
I will show you how we do that as we write
our first program.
