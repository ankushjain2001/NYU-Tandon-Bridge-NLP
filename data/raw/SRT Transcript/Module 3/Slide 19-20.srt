00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,649
Ok so let’s start to write our first C++
program.

2
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:11,860
Let’s make it easy let’s write a program
that reads from the user to numbers and just

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,809
prints what the sum of these numbers are.

4
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:18,880
So we want to interact with the user something
like that we would first ask the user please

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,500
enter two numbers separated by a space.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,130
The user would enter for example 7 and 5 and
then the program would respond 7 plus 5 equals

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,130
12.

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,960
Let’s see how we write it in C++.
