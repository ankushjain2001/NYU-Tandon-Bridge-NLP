1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:00,940
Okay.

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:08,680
So we're going to prove that for any natural
number N, two N square plus five N minus six

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,750
is greater or equal to zero.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,800
Before we start just know that this statement
here is of the form for any natural number

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,330
and P of N is true, where this here are P
of N: two N square plus five N minus six greater

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,050
equal to zero, that's a P of N. Okay.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:36,230
Let's start to disprove here; know there are
a lot of ways to show this statement here.

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,300
But we’ll use induction, you know, in order
to prove it.

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:58,330
So, it's first state that we will prove using
induction on N. And as we said there are two

10
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:08,250
steps: there is the base and there is the
inductive step.

11
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,580
So, let's start with the base.

12
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:19,909
The base: we are supposed to show that P of
one is true; basically, that this thing here

13
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,330
is true for any cause one.

14
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:35,909
And that's quite easy because for any cause
one, we get that two times one square plus

15
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:44,700
five times one minus six basically equals
to one which is greater or equal to zero just

16
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,560
as required.

17
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,270
Now, let's try to show; let's try to do the
inductive step.

18
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,100
So for the inductive step, we said that we're
going to assume that P of N minus one is true,

19
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,270
and under that assumption we'll show that
P of N is also true.

20
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:18,739
So we assume that P of N minus one is true,
that means we should just take N minus one

21
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:28,590
instead of N in our statement; two N minus
one square plus five N minus one minus six

22
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,260
is greater or equal to zero.

23
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,209
So, that's our assumption.

24
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:45,169
And we’ll show that under that assumption
two N square plus five N minus six is also

25
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,840
greater or equal to zero.

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,599
So, this here is our assumption and this here
is what we need to show.

27
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,810
And we’ll use our assumption for, to show
that thing.

28
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,859
So, okay.

29
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:14,120
So let's see; two N square plus five N minus
six.

30
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,099
Let's see how we can make it using our assumption.

31
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:28,249
So hopefully it would just be equal to two
N minus one square plus five N minus one minus

32
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,379
six.

33
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:35,409
If these two expressions were equal, using
our assumption we can just say that the right

34
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:42,669
hand side is greater or equal to zero and
therefore two N square plus five N minus six

35
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,469
is greater or equal to zero.

36
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:50,681
Unfortunately, they're not equal because of
this thing here is, and I'll simplify it,

37
00:03:50,681 --> 00:04:00,379
it goes, gets to two N square plus N minus
nine.

38
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:08,359
So, we can fix this expression for it to be
equal and for that we would need, okay, so

39
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:13,049
two N square, we have on both sides.

40
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:20,169
On the left hand we have five N, on the right
hand we have, and so we need to add four N.

41
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:25,240
On the left hand we have negative six on the
right hand we have a negative nine so let's

42
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:33,020
just add three more, and now these two things
are equal to one another.

43
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:40,319
So, now that's very easy because, it's very
useful actually, because we know that this

44
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,690
thing here is greater or equal to zero; that's
our inductive assumption.

45
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:53,220
We also know that four N plus three, also,
is greater or equal to zero because N is greater

46
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,240
or equal to two, is a positive integer.

47
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,939
So, if we multiplied by four and add three
we would definitely get a positive number.

48
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:08,590
Therefore, these two add-ins, basically, are
greater equal to zero plus zero, which is

49
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,590
their zero.

50
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:16,920
All together, we get that two N square five
N minus six is greater or equal to zero.

51
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,400
So, the inductive step showed that given our
assumption: that's two N minus one squared

52
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,120
plus five N minus one minus six is greater
or equal to zero.

53
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,710
Given that assumption, we can then say that
two N square plus five N minus six, itself,

54
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,279
is greater or equal to zero.
