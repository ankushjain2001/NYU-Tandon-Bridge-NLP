1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,580
Let's write another recursive implementation.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,710
This time let's implement the function are
all even; this function gets in the range

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,530
of integers as a parameter and its logical
size N. and it should return true if all of

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,810
the elements in this array even, if not all
of them are even it would just return false.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,179
For example, if weâ€™ll call this function
with an array, let's say four, six, zero,

6
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:30,859
and two and the logical size four, obviously
it would return true because all of the elements

7
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:32,500
here are even.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,840
If we'll call this function with the array
four, seven, zero, and two with logical size

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,100
four, it would return false because not of
all of the elements here are even.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,390
For example, seven in this case is odd.

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,570
Let's try to have a recursive implementation
using a computer; let's do that now.
