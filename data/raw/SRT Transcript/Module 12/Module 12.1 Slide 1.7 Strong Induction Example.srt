1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:06,060
Let’s show that every natural number can
be written as a power of two times an odd

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,060
number.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,990
Once again you can see that this statement
is of the form for any natural number some

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:18,390
P of N is true; this is our P of N and know
that N can be written in some form.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's go ahead and prove it.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,980
Actually before we start proving using strong
induction, let's see that just the regular

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,700
mathematical induction can't really help us
here.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,270
So, in regular induction we would probably
say that we assume that P of N minus one is

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,300
true or basically N minus one can be written
in the form of two to the power of some I

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,920
times an odd number J, so let's assume we
have that.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,680
And given that, we should show that N is also
some power of two times an odd number.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,900
The only straightforward way I'm thinking
of combining N with N minus one is just adding

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,830
one to it, but then if N minus one is two
to the I times J, if I'll add one to it, I

14
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:08,260
won't get something of the form some power
of I times J. But then if we know that this

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,330
thing is true, not only for N minus one but
for all other values of N.

16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,870
For example, I know that N is two times N
by two.

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:23,880
So, if I know that N by two, for example,
is two times two to the power of I times J,

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,020
then N would be two times two to the power
of I times J, which would be some power of

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,180
two times an odd number.

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,570
So, using the assumption on a smaller value
than N minus one, in this case N by two, seems

21
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,710
to be helpful more than using the assumption
of N minus one.

22
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,549
That's why a strong induction here is better.

23
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,450
Let's use a strong induction to show exactly
that.

24
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,450
Okay.

25
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:57,930
So, a proof will prove by a strong induction
on N. And once again, we have two steps: the

26
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,229
base and inductive step.

27
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,310
So for the base, we should show that P of
one is true.

28
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:12,319
So, for any cause one, we should show how
we can represent one as some power of two

29
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,680
times an odd number.

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,999
So, that's very easy cause one is two to the
zero times one.

31
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:24,611
So, if we take our power of two to be zero,
the exponent to be zero, and our odd number

32
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:32,439
to be one we get that one is basically two
to the zero times one, just as requested.

33
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,689
And now, let's do the inductive step.

34
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:40,560
In this case, we should assume that P of N
is true for any value smaller than N. And

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,389
using that assumption, we should show that
P of N is true, so let's have this assumption

36
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:46,389
ready.

37
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:55,439
So we assume that every K smaller than N can
be written in the form of K equals two to

38
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:03,909
some power of I times J, where obviously I
is a non-negative integer and J is odd.

39
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,359
So, this is our assumption; it's cement.

40
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:12,280
And now we show that N itself can also be
written in this form.

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,939
Now we show that N can be written as two to
the power of I times J, obviously other I's

42
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:23,419
and J’s here, with I and J as described.

43
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,519
So, this is what we need to show.

44
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,489
So, we’ll use this assumption here in order
to show that N can be represented this way

45
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:36,590
and this assumption is for every value of
K; for K equals N minus one, N minus two,

46
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,329
N minus three, and so on.

47
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,209
Also for K equals N by two, which would be
the value of K that we would like to use this

48
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:44,209
assumption on.

49
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,420
Yeah, so let's do that.

50
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,129
The only thing is that we need to take care,
or in other words, not every N has an integer

51
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:57,079
N by two; odd numbers you can't really divide
by two and get another integer value after

52
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,079
this division.

53
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,480
So, let's separate to the two cases when our
N is odd and when it's even and do all of

54
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
that.

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,719
So, we have two cases to take care of: the
first is that N is odd; the second is that

56
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,840
N is even.

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,310
So, for the second case that's the main part
of this proof is when we're going to use the

58
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,220
inductive assumption on N by two.

59
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,260
The first case is quite easy when N is odd,
obviously you can represent it as a power

60
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,200
of two times an odd number, just take the
power of two to be zero, so it would be one

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,520
times N itself.

62
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:41,540
So, in this case, if we take I to be zero
and J to be N, we get that N equals two to

63
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:49,770
the power of zero times N, which is obviously
N, and I and J are as requested; so, we're

64
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,770
fine.

65
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,440
In the case where N is even, now we're going
to do what we basically said we'll do here

66
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
in this case.

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:05,491
Since N by two is less than N, by the inductive
hypothesis, if we take K to be N by two, we

68
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:12,064
get that N by two is then equal to two to
the power of two to the power of some, let's

69
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:21,460
say, I prime times J prime for our non-negative
I prime and all J prime.

70
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,310
And now we can, given that, we can present
N in other requested form.

71
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,750
So, since N is basically two times N by two,
in the case where N is even, that is exactly

72
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,750
the case.

73
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:42,050
We get that N is two times two to the power
of I prime times J prime, which is basically

74
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,720
two to the power of I prime plus one times
J prime.

75
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:54,280
Therefore, if we take our I to be I prime
plus one, the value that the inductive assumption

76
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:02,840
gave us for the power of two for N by two
plus one and J prime to be or our J to be

77
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,160
the same as J prime.

78
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,430
Then, we get a N written in the requested
form.

79
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,000
That concludes our proof here using strong induction.
