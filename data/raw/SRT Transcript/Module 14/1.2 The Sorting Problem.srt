00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,580
In this Module, we're going to talk about
sorting algorithms.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,210
Let's start first by stating the problem,
kind of obvious by the name you can probably

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,330
guess what this problem is trying to solve,
but let's be formal here.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,380
So given an array, AR of numbers, let's change
their order.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,510
So at the end they would show in an increasing
order.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:28,800
So for example if our original array contains
some values: five, eight, twelve, seven, and

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
so on.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,510
After sorting, the array elements would change
their order.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,230
So, they are now there would be: five, seven,
eight, eight, ten, twelve, again in increasing

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,550
order.
