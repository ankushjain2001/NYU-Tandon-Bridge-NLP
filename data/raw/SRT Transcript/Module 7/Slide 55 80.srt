0:00:00.520,0:00:05.730
Ok so far we have two solutions two versions.

0:00:05.730,0:00:09.600
One iterating over the entire range from one
through num.

0:00:09.600,0:00:14.960
The second iterating over half of the range
from one through num by two.

0:00:14.960,0:00:21.000
I want to suggest another version a third
version here.

0:00:21.000,0:00:28.920
In this case we will iterate not on the second
half we will iterate only on the first square

0:00:28.920,0:00:33.730
root of num that first values.

0:00:33.730,0:00:40.000
So instead of going from one through num by
two we will go from one to the square root

0:00:40.000,0:00:43.440
of num which is less than num by two.

0:00:43.440,0:00:50.270
Let’s take a look at 100 here as an example
here these are the factors of 100.

0:00:50.270,0:00:54.380
Now 50 is 100 by two is num by two.

0:00:54.380,0:00:58.170
And the square root of 100 is less than 50
is 10.

0:00:58.170,0:01:05.609
So actually when we are taking a look at these
factors of 100 doesn’t seem like such a

0:01:05.609,0:01:13.020
great idea to go only on the first square
root of num values.

0:01:13.020,0:01:17.400
And to test how many to count how many of
them are dividers.

0:01:17.400,0:01:23.549
Because here in this case we have a few dividers
that are less than the square root but not

0:01:23.549,0:01:28.069
like num by two that there aren’t any dividers
greater than num by two.

0:01:28.069,0:01:33.189
It seems like there are a few dividers that
are greater than square root of num right

0:01:33.189,0:01:39.119
20 25 50 they are all dividers of 100 that
are greater than the square root.

0:01:39.119,0:01:48.170
So it makes me wonder whether it is a correct
idea or a correct algorithm to count the dividers

0:01:48.170,0:01:53.079
only in the first square root of num values.

0:01:53.079,0:01:59.600
Maybe by going only in that small range we
won’t find any dividers and all of them

0:01:59.600,0:02:04.729
are kind of in the other part or the other
portion of the range.

0:02:04.729,0:02:11.640
From the square root to num maybe we are missing
some dividers if we go only on this partial

0:02:11.640,0:02:14.599
range here.

0:02:14.599,0:02:20.650
But if we think about it a bit more deeply
for example for 100 so 10 is the square root

0:02:20.650,0:02:28.440
we will see that each divider that is greater
than the square root in this case 100 has

0:02:28.440,0:02:32.670
a complimentary divider that is less than
100 in this case one.

0:02:32.670,0:02:39.920
Same thing 50 is a divider greater than the
square root 2 is its complimentary divider

0:02:39.920,0:02:42.160
that is less than the square root.

0:02:42.160,0:02:45.410
And so 25 and 4 and 20 and 5.

0:02:45.410,0:02:53.460
So in some sense maybe we are skipping maybe
we are not counting the entire number of dividers

0:02:53.460,0:03:02.880
but going over the first part the first portion
up to the square root we will find at least

0:03:02.880,0:03:08.040
one divider in each complimentary pair of
dividers.

0:03:08.040,0:03:16.450
So makes us think that maybe it is a good
idea to go only on the first square root values

0:03:16.450,0:03:18.820
and count the number of dividers there.

0:03:18.820,0:03:24.210
We kind of believe that if there are none
dividers in the first portion there there

0:03:24.210,0:03:29.150
won’t be any complimentary dividers in the
second portion.

0:03:29.150,0:03:34.910
We would obviously need to prove that generally
not only for 100.

0:03:34.910,0:03:37.890
And that’s exactly what we are going to
do right now.

0:03:37.890,0:03:45.420
So the proofing technique we are going to
use here is called proof by contradiction

0:03:45.420,0:03:51.600
where we want to show some property let’s
say we want to show A. In this technique proof

0:03:51.600,0:04:00.000
by contradiction in order to show that A is
true we assume that A is not true kind of

0:04:00.000,0:04:08.440
assume the contradiction the negation of A.
We assume A is false and then we will just

0:04:08.440,0:04:13.500
do some arguments and get to some universal
contradiction.

0:04:13.500,0:04:19.669
I don’t know that one equals zero or some
other thing that cannot hold.

0:04:19.669,0:04:28.889
And by having a premise of A is false and
getting a contradiction we will conclude that

0:04:28.889,0:04:34.349
this assumption that A is not true is false.

0:04:34.349,0:04:38.930
In other words that A must be true.

0:04:38.930,0:04:45.330
In this example let’s see how we use proof
by contradiction as a proofing technique.

0:04:45.330,0:04:54.340
So let’s assume k and d are two complimentary
dividers of num and the thing we cannot allow

0:04:54.340,0:05:00.629
since we want to show that at least one in
each pair is less than the square root.

0:05:00.629,0:05:08.050
Our assumption would be that let’s assume
that both of them are not less than a square

0:05:08.050,0:05:09.050
root.

0:05:09.050,0:05:13.340
Or in other words both of them are greater
than the square root.

0:05:13.340,0:05:18.659
And we will show that that can hold we can’t
have two dividers two complimentary dividers

0:05:18.659,0:05:21.029
that are both greater than the square root.

0:05:21.029,0:05:27.539
So let’s assume that it is the case here
both are greater than the square root.

0:05:27.539,0:05:33.960
And since we know that they are complimentary
dividers we know that when we multiply them

0:05:33.960,0:05:35.650
they would result to num.

0:05:35.650,0:05:38.309
So num equals k times d.

0:05:38.309,0:05:41.389
Now we assume that they are both greater than
the square root.

0:05:41.389,0:05:45.620
Basically k is greater than the square root
of num and d is greater than the square root

0:05:45.620,0:05:46.620
of num.

0:05:46.620,0:05:51.999
Therefore when we multiply k by d we get something
that is greater than the square root of num

0:05:51.999,0:05:53.960
times square root of num right.

0:05:53.960,0:05:58.830
K is greater than the square root d is greater
than square root k times d is greater than

0:05:58.830,0:06:01.080
square root times square root.

0:06:01.080,0:06:02.569
Which is equal to num.

0:06:02.569,0:06:10.809
Altogether when we take it we get that num
is greater than num now that’s absurd right.

0:06:10.809,0:06:13.319
No number is greater than itself.

0:06:13.319,0:06:15.159
Seven is not greater than seven.

0:06:15.159,0:06:16.819
Five is not greater than five.

0:06:16.819,0:06:20.780
Num greater than num that’s an obvious contradiction.

0:06:20.780,0:06:27.439
Which implies that our initial assumption
that both of our dividers are greater than

0:06:27.439,0:06:28.789
num is false.

0:06:28.789,0:06:36.949
Or in other words it implies that at least
one on each pair of complimentary dividers

0:06:36.949,0:06:40.470
is less than the square root of num.

0:06:40.470,0:06:48.949
Ok so given that now that we know that it
is good enough to go only on the first portion

0:06:48.949,0:06:51.749
of the range here from one to the square root.

0:06:51.749,0:07:00.080
Let’s see how we update our implementation
so yea it is kind of straightforward.

0:07:00.080,0:07:05.990
Instead of just going from one to num or from
one to the num by two we will go from num

0:07:05.990,0:07:10.449
to the from one to the square root of num.

0:07:10.449,0:07:18.930
And in order to say that our num is a prime
we are expecting to have only one divider

0:07:18.930,0:07:22.169
in this range which is the number one itself.

0:07:22.169,0:07:25.319
So the implementation would look something
like that.
