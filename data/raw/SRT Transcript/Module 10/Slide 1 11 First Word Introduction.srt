Let’s try to write a program that reads
from the user three words and then prints

0:00:05.690,0:00:08.910
the one that comes first in an alphabetical
order.

0:00:08.910,0:00:13.250
For example let’s prompt the user please
enter three words separated by space.

0:00:13.250,0:00:18.019
The user can then enter I don’t know dolphin
cat tiger.

0:00:18.019,0:00:23.980
And then the program should respond with word
that comes first in a lexicographical order.

0:00:23.980,0:00:25.800
In this case it is cat.

0:00:25.800,0:00:27.900
Let’s go ahead and implement it.
