0:00:00.070,0:00:04.590
Let’s start by prompting the user to enter
three words separated by space.

0:00:04.590,0:00:11.980
So please enter three words separated by space
and let’s break the line.

0:00:11.980,0:00:14.629
And then let’s read these three words.

0:00:14.629,0:00:20.789
Let’s first include the string library and
then let’s declare three string variables.

0:00:20.789,0:00:26.730
So let’s have word one word two and word
three.

0:00:26.730,0:00:29.710
And now we need to read three words into these
variables.

0:00:29.710,0:00:36.989
Since each of them is supposed to be a single
word actually cin is a good way to read these

0:00:36.989,0:00:40.000
words into these variables because cin separated
by space.

0:00:40.000,0:00:47.320
So we can just do cin into word one into word
two and into word three.

0:00:47.320,0:00:50.690
So now we have the three words in these variables.

0:00:50.690,0:00:54.350
Now let’s try to determine which one is
the smallest.

0:00:54.350,0:01:00.329
So I was thinking of having a multiway if
statement here three cases.

0:01:00.329,0:01:05.660
Checking if word one is the smallest if word
two is the smallest or otherwise it is obviously

0:01:05.660,0:01:06.660
word three.

0:01:06.660,0:01:11.510
So let’s have an if statement and let’s
figure out a condition that determines whether

0:01:11.510,0:01:14.170
word one is the smallest of the three.

0:01:14.170,0:01:23.220
So we can do something like if word one is
less or equal to word two and also word one

0:01:23.220,0:01:26.490
is less or equal to word three.

0:01:26.490,0:01:32.800
If this is true basically it means that word
one is both less than word two and less than

0:01:32.800,0:01:33.800
word three.

0:01:33.800,0:01:40.000
It is thus the smallest of them all in this
case we’ll just cout word one let’s break

0:01:40.000,0:01:41.000
the line.

0:01:41.000,0:01:47.549
Otherwise let’s do the same to check if
word two is the smallest so if word two is

0:01:47.549,0:01:54.250
less or equal to word one and word two is
less or equal to word three.

0:01:54.250,0:02:00.180
That means word two is the smallest of the
three so we should print word two break the

0:02:00.180,0:02:01.220
line.

0:02:01.220,0:02:08.580
And otherwise I will just comment that word
three is the smallest in this caser we’ll

0:02:08.580,0:02:10.220
just print word three.

0:02:10.220,0:02:16.270
That’s supposed to be good enough let’s
test and make sure we didn’t do anything

0:02:16.270,0:02:17.490
wrong here.

0:02:17.490,0:02:25.850
So please enter three words separated by space
so we have dolphin cat and tiger.

0:02:25.850,0:02:30.490
And that it just prints cat and yea that is
the smallest word of these three.
