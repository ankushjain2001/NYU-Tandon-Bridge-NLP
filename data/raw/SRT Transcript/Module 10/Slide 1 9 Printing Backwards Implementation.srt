0:00:00.080,0:00:01.780
Let’s go ahead and implement this program.

0:00:01.780,0:00:07.859
So first let’s prompt the user cout please
enter your name and break the line.

0:00:07.859,0:00:13.070
And then let’s read the user’s name so
for that let’s first include the string

0:00:13.070,0:00:16.369
library and let’s create a string variable.

0:00:16.369,0:00:17.910
Let’s name it username.

0:00:17.910,0:00:22.730
And let’s read whatever the user enters
into the user name variable.

0:00:22.730,0:00:28.230
Since the user name would be first and last
name it would probably contain spaces so let’s

0:00:28.230,0:00:30.710
use the get line syntax for that.

0:00:30.710,0:00:35.790
So get line first parameter as we said it’s
cin basically saying that that input comes

0:00:35.790,0:00:38.540
from the keyboard from the user.

0:00:38.540,0:00:42.770
And the user name that is where we want it
to read it to.

0:00:42.770,0:00:45.490
So now we have the user name string.

0:00:45.490,0:00:50.700
What we need to do now is what I was thinking
is to create a new string with the reverse

0:00:50.700,0:00:51.700
name in it.

0:00:51.700,0:00:56.890
Let’s create another string variable or
actually since we’ll just need to print

0:00:56.890,0:01:02.420
this name we don’t need to create a string
we can just iterate and print in each iterator.

0:01:02.420,0:01:06.190
But then we would need to go in a reverse
order we need to go from the enter to the

0:01:06.190,0:01:07.190
beginning.

0:01:07.190,0:01:08.880
I think it is a good practice let’s use
a for loop.

0:01:08.880,0:01:15.900
I will have an index variable and in this
case we should initialize index to the end

0:01:15.900,0:01:21.250
of the string and each iterator instead of
incrementing index we will decrease index.

0:01:21.250,0:01:24.200
We’ll do something like index minus minus.

0:01:24.200,0:01:29.590
So let’s think of what value the index should
be set to initially.

0:01:29.590,0:01:32.870
That should be the index of the last character
in the string.

0:01:32.870,0:01:39.780
We can definitely use the length method for
that so it would be user name dot length that’s

0:01:39.780,0:01:42.740
basically the number of characters in this
string.

0:01:42.740,0:01:47.980
But then if we think about it let’s say
we have a string ABC the length is three but

0:01:47.980,0:01:50.760
the last character is in the index two right.

0:01:50.760,0:01:56.240
Because like since it is a zero based index
system it starts at zero and ends at basically

0:01:56.240,0:01:57.790
length minus one.

0:01:57.790,0:02:03.140
So let’s set the initial index to username
length minus one.

0:02:03.140,0:02:08.340
That’s the index that’s the position of
the last character in the username string.

0:02:08.340,0:02:12.000
So initially index is the length minus one.

0:02:12.000,0:02:19.400
Each iterator index is decreased and we keep
on going as long as our index is greater or

0:02:19.400,0:02:21.300
equal to zero.

0:02:21.300,0:02:24.730
Basically it is still a valid index we can
access.

0:02:24.730,0:02:29.060
Each iterator we’ll just print the current
character we are at.

0:02:29.060,0:02:36.880
So let’s cout username at the index position
so first iteration would print the last character.

0:02:36.880,0:02:40.280
Then we’ll decrease index and we’ll print
the character that comes before that.

0:02:40.280,0:02:45.040
We’ll decrease index and print the character
that comes before that and so on until index

0:02:45.040,0:02:48.690
equals zero in the last iteration where we’d
print the first character.

0:02:48.690,0:02:54.160
At the end let’s just break the line so
cout end l here.

0:02:54.160,0:03:01.130
And seems to be fine let’s try to execute
it make sure we didn’t make any silly mistakes.

0:03:01.130,0:03:08.180
So please enter your name Donald Duck and
then it just prints it in a reverse order.

0:03:08.180,0:03:13.780
Great another option here would be as I started
before to create a string variable with a

0:03:13.780,0:03:18.790
reverse name in it it would be a great practice
for you to try to implement this version on

0:03:18.790,0:03:19.290
your own.
