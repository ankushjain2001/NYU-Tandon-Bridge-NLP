0:00:00.470,0:00:08.040
So we can basically take separate elements
from a string using the indexing system indexing

0:00:08.040,0:00:11.540
syntax just like arrays.

0:00:11.540,0:00:17.369
We can do something even a bit more advanced
with strings we can take a slice of a string

0:00:17.369,0:00:19.019
out.

0:00:19.019,0:00:24.239
That is the slicing syntax and it works something
like that.

0:00:24.239,0:00:31.649
In order to take a slice to take a sub string
out of a string we use the sub str method.

0:00:31.649,0:00:39.900
The way we call this method is str one dot
sub str and then we have two parameters basically

0:00:39.900,0:00:44.740
saying where this sub string starts and how
long is this sub string.

0:00:44.740,0:00:49.370
In this case this sub string would start at
index three and it would be two characters

0:00:49.370,0:00:50.370
long.

0:00:50.370,0:00:58.370
So index three is a D two characters long
the sub string is basically DE in this case.

0:00:58.370,0:01:04.309
Now I believe you’ve noticed that the syntax
for calling this method is a bit different

0:01:04.309,0:01:09.560
than what we are used to when we’ve used
functions.

0:01:09.560,0:01:17.500
Probably you’ve you probably thought that
in order to create the sub string of str one

0:01:17.500,0:01:20.220
starting at index three and it’s two characters
long.

0:01:20.220,0:01:27.960
We should use sub str as a function and pass
str one and three and two as three different

0:01:27.960,0:01:32.040
parameters and that would obviously a right
way of thinking.

0:01:32.040,0:01:34.909
That’s how we’ve used functions so far.

0:01:34.909,0:01:40.030
But then I’ve said that sub str is a method
and that’s a bit different.

0:01:40.030,0:01:45.950
We’ll talk about it in much more detail
when we speak about object oriented programming

0:01:45.950,0:01:52.780
and classes and you will see that methods
how exactly or how formally they are defined.

0:01:52.780,0:01:57.090
For now I just want you to know that sub str
is a method it is not a function so we are

0:01:57.090,0:02:04.490
not calling it sub str with three parameters
the string the starting index and the length.

0:02:04.490,0:02:10.560
We are kind of passing the str one parameter
in a different way.

0:02:10.560,0:02:14.290
Str one is basically the calling object of
this method.

0:02:14.290,0:02:23.250
So sub str is aware of str one it is operating
on str on it is taking the sub str of str

0:02:23.250,0:02:25.640
one without us passing it as a parameter.

0:02:25.640,0:02:31.200
We’ve used the dot notation in order to
make str one be our calling object.

0:02:31.200,0:02:36.520
So we use str one dot sub str three and two.

0:02:36.520,0:02:44.560
So we are calling the method sub str on str
one and the additional parameters are three

0:02:44.560,0:02:45.560
and two.

0:02:45.560,0:02:54.690
If we’ll for example print str one dot sub
str three two that would print DE.

0:02:54.690,0:03:00.200
I hope it makes sense we will use methods
in other cases as well.

0:03:00.200,0:03:05.239
Each time we are going to use a method I will
explicitly say that this functionality is

0:03:05.239,0:03:07.800
not a function it is a method.

0:03:07.800,0:03:10.510
In this case sub str is a method.

0:03:10.510,0:03:18.790
If we’ll think about the result or the value
of whatever sub str returns that is basically

0:03:18.790,0:03:22.040
in this case it was a DE it was of type string.

0:03:22.040,0:03:29.080
So we can do something like str two equals
str one dot sub str two three.

0:03:29.080,0:03:35.790
Basically taking the sub string of str one
once again our calling object is str one.

0:03:35.790,0:03:42.099
Starting at index two in this case which is
the C and it is three characters long.

0:03:42.099,0:03:50.970
So str or the result of this method call would
be a string of length three CDE.

0:03:50.970,0:03:58.379
And that would be str two so we are assigning
str one dot sub str into a string variable

0:03:58.379,0:03:59.379
into str two.

0:03:59.379,0:04:10.569
If we’ll print str two as expected it would
print CDE which is the three characters string

0:04:10.569,0:04:12.150
that sub str returned.

0:04:12.150,0:04:18.540
So the slicing syntax is using the sub str
method we have our calling object for example

0:04:18.540,0:04:25.840
it could be the str variable and then two
additional parameters come in parentheses.

0:04:25.840,0:04:28.680
The starting location and the length of this
sub string.
