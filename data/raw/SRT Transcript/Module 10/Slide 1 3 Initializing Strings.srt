So far we’ve seen that in order to use the
string type we need to include the string

0:00:06.930,0:00:14.549
library. Then we can declare a string variable
in this case string str. And then we can initialize

0:00:14.549,0:00:24.510
str with some textual data which is basically
a line of text or a string enclosed in double

0:00:24.510,0:00:34.620
quotes. Formally the double quote ABC is not
a class string type it is formally a c string

0:00:34.620,0:00:46.399
type. But C++ has a default an implicit cast
from c string to the string class. So for

0:00:46.399,0:00:54.290
us it would be considered to be just a string
so we would have str equals ABC. And then

0:00:54.290,0:01:00.719
we can also use the plus operator that’s
also a thing that we’ve seen about strings.

0:01:00.719,0:01:08.810
Plus basically let’s us concatenate strings
one after the other. So we’ll do for example

0:01:08.810,0:01:18.100
str plus DEF since str is ABC str plus DEF
basically concatenates ABC and DEF giving

0:01:18.100,0:01:24.370
us the text ABCDEF. So when we print it we
just get ABCDEF.
