1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:07,460
So, if we now modify the definition of a process,
we need to change where things are stored

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,470
inside that process.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:14,200
So if we take a look, the PCB still has most
of the stuff that we would recognize: the

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,830
memory allocation, all the memory and IO tables,
all the files all the linkages, all that stuff.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,440
But the thread now needs to keep track of
some of the thread specific things like the

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,019
context, the stack, the variables that are
specific to that thread.

7
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,430
All of that needs to be offloaded outside
of the PCB and inside maybe a TCB, a thread

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,320
control block, to keep track of each of the
individual threads.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,820
Now the fun part about threads is that they
all have access to the resources, the memory

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,760
and all the rest of the stuff, from the process,
and that means that we have a great level

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,390
of communication between all the threads inside
of a process.

12
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,760
But the process needs to recognize, or the
threads really need to recognize that they

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,570
exist inside of a process and there are some
concurrency issues that come up in relation

14
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,890
to that.

15
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,250
Now what about your old programs, like your
‘Hello World’ programs that you've written

16
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,960
for previous modules, do they have threads?

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,060
Well they did; they had one thread, the main
thread and that main thread could have, although

18
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:27,159
it didn't create other threads to do other
tasks each individual task inside the system

19
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,170
can be or inside the process rather, can be
handled by one thread and each of the threads

20
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,250
do their own sort of work.

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,530
But they all work together on one project
one process and they all share the materials

22
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,310
of that process.
