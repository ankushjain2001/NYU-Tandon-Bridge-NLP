1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,210
So, the process is made up of the code, data
and context.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,850
And we're talking about the process being
a running program in a system state, and we're

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,950
gonna talk about what system states mean,
in detail, in the next topic.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,690
But for now, we'll simply say that when the
program starts, it has to have all the information

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,250
that it needs in order to run; specifically,
the code as well as any data it may need initially.

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,660
And then the operating system needs to keep
track of a lot of information about the running

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,850
program, and that's what we're gonna call
that the context.

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,380
The code all has to be run in sequential memory;
you know this, you've done some programming.

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,760
You've done quite a bit of programming and
you're gonna have to recognize that the code

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,450
starts from point one and proceeds sequentially
through the entire program.

11
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,320
And so that code needs to be loaded into sequential
memory.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,629
The process is a way for the operating system
to keep track of the state of the running

13
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,239
program, and the resources assigned to that
running program.
