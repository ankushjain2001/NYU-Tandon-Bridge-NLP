0:00:00.080,0:00:02.820
First we need to read the number of students.

0:00:02.820,0:00:07.970
So let’s create a variable num of students.

0:00:07.970,0:00:14.969
And let’s ask the user please enter the
number of students in class and end the line.

0:00:14.969,0:00:19.180
And just read it into this num of students.

0:00:19.180,0:00:24.970
Then we should announce to the user to start
entering the sequence of grades.

0:00:24.970,0:00:28.230
So let’s say enter the students’ grades.

0:00:28.230,0:00:33.770
Let’s also ask the user to separate them
by space.

0:00:33.770,0:00:36.970
Ok I think that’s good enough instructions
here for the user.

0:00:36.970,0:00:41.690
Ok so now we should start reading the numbers
and adding them up.

0:00:41.690,0:00:45.410
For that we would need some kind of iterative
process.

0:00:45.410,0:00:48.430
Since we know exactly how many iterations
we are going to have.

0:00:48.430,0:00:50.820
We are going to have num of students iterations.

0:00:50.820,0:00:53.570
A for loop here is a good choice.

0:00:53.570,0:01:03.020
So let’s create some counter variable initialize
it to 1 and each iteration will just increment

0:01:03.020,0:01:04.460
this count.

0:01:04.460,0:01:09.650
And if we want to do num of students iteration
starting a 1 incrementing it by 1 each time

0:01:09.650,0:01:16.000
we just need to make sure that count is less
or equal to num of students in order to keep

0:01:16.000,0:01:17.000
on going.

0:01:17.000,0:01:20.030
Let’s just declare this count variable.

0:01:20.030,0:01:28.550
So this for loop header here basically controls
process that does num of students iterations.

0:01:28.550,0:01:32.930
And then we said that each iteration we want
to read an input.

0:01:32.930,0:01:39.060
Let’s read it into current variable and
to add it to some accumulator.

0:01:39.060,0:01:42.340
So we should let’s first declare current.

0:01:42.340,0:01:49.990
We also need some variable that actually should
be initialized before we start iterating.

0:01:49.990,0:01:56.650
So first it is initialized to zero and then
each iteration we just add to sum the value

0:01:56.650,0:01:59.120
of the current element we read.

0:01:59.120,0:02:05.560
So if we take a second look at this piece
of code here we first initialize sum to zero

0:02:05.560,0:02:09.149
and then we start iterating num of students
times.

0:02:09.149,0:02:13.980
Each time we read an input and add it to sum
over and over.

0:02:13.980,0:02:15.920
Read an input add it to sum.

0:02:15.920,0:02:20.780
At the end we would have the total sum of
all the grades the user entered.

0:02:20.780,0:02:25.380
We can then calculate the average as divide
sum by a number of students.

0:02:25.380,0:02:28.140
Let’s create a variable for the average.

0:02:28.140,0:02:33.110
Even though the grades are integers and number
of students is integer.

0:02:33.110,0:02:40.010
The average could be a number with a fractional
part so for that I would define the average

0:02:40.010,0:02:41.670
variable as a double.

0:02:41.670,0:02:51.400
And then I would just assign average to sum
divided by num of students.

0:02:51.400,0:02:57.849
Then again a closer look here would suggest
that the slash operator in the context of

0:02:57.849,0:03:04.940
dividing two integers won’t do a real division
but would basically do integer division div.

0:03:04.940,0:03:11.840
So in order to make it a real division we
would need to cast both sum and number of

0:03:11.840,0:03:13.410
students to double.

0:03:13.410,0:03:19.380
Now average is the result of really dividing
a sum by number of students.

0:03:19.380,0:03:26.739
We should just now announce that the average
is average is and then we will just print

0:03:26.739,0:03:31.390
the value of the variable average and end
the line.

0:03:31.390,0:03:33.129
That basically should be the program.

0:03:33.129,0:03:35.099
Let’s test it out.

0:03:35.099,0:03:37.120
Compile it and execute it.

0:03:37.120,0:03:39.360
No bugs here which is good.

0:03:39.360,0:03:42.780
Enter the number of students so we have four
students.

0:03:42.780,0:03:53.660
Enter the grades let’s just do I don’t
know 89 75 93 and 78.

0:03:53.660,0:03:58.599
And then the average is 83.75 I believe that’s
the average here.

0:03:58.599,0:03:59.390
Looks good.
