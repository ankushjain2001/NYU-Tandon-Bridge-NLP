1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:07,050
There is a sequential flow IO expressions
arithmetic expressions and data of a type

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,820
int.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:17,520
Today we are going to focus mostly on some
data types there are several data types that

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,460
are used in C++.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,230
There is the int we already talked about.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:32,379
We are going to talk about float and double
which are going to be used to represent real

7
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:36,510
numbers numbers with a fractional part.

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:45,219
There is a char that is used for characters
there is string for textual information and

9
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:48,600
there bool for Boolean values True and False.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,620
We are going to talk in much detail about
each and every one of these data types.

11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,940
We are going to start talking about int we
are going to do it right away.
