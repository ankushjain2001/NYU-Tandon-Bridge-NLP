00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,939
Letâ€™s take a second look at a problem we
already implemented the program that reads

2
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:15,349
from the user two numbers and print their
sum and see if we can find some of these constructs

3
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,430
some data expressions and control flow.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:25,130
So here is the program we implemented you
can see that when this program is executed

5
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,830
it is executed line after line.

6
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,140
First there is cout that prints an instruction
to the user please enter two numbers.

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,539
Then there is the cin that reads from the
user these two numbers then we add them store

8
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:47,429
them into sum and eventually we print out
the message that whatever the sum is.

9
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:52,379
You can see that the program is executed line
by line we call this flow a sequential flow.

10
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,930
This is a default flow of a program that lines
executed one after the other.

11
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:04,729
You could also see that we have here some
data we have three variables numOne numTwo

12
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:13,360
sum they are all integers in C which is a
C++ which is a strongly type language.

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,380
Each data must have a type of its own in this
case both or all of our variables are integers

14
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,460
int.

15
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,330
There are also expressions here in our program
there is numOne plus numTwo there is an assignment

16
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,369
expressions there is a cout a cin an io expression.

17
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:41,259
So there are all the kinds of these constructs
here in this program.
