1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,930
Let’s implement this program so first let’s
ask the user to enter the number of days they

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:14,389
travel so cout. And then please enter number
of days you traveled. Let’s break the line

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:21,700
end line. And then let’s read whatever the
user enters into a variable. Since it is number

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,990
of days int is the type we want to use here.
We first have to declare this variable so

5
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,400
int. And then we have to decide what the name
of this variable would be. In my previous

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,580
examples I just used x y z whatever because
they had no meaning just to show you the syntax

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:43,230
of integers. But here in this program this
variable would be used to store some significant

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,140
kind of data. It is going to store the days
user traveled. So let’s give it meaningful

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,410
name in this case I would name it days traveled.
But then I can’t have a variable name days

10
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:01,910
traveled made of two words. So I need to somehow
create a single word that would be made of

11
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:07,221
more than one word in it. So there are a few
common conventions on how to do that. One

12
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:12,270
way is to separate the word something like
underscore symbol something like that into

13
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,140
days traveled. Another convention could be
something like to capitalize the beginning

14
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,670
of each word days traveled and then easily
you can see what this long sequence of characters

15
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:30,499
basically mean. Third convention is to start
capitalizing only from the second word so

16
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:36,880
the first d is lower case then the t for the
travel is uppercase. For variable names the

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,979
common C++ convention is something like that.
Capitalizing each word starting with the second

18
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:50,460
word so int days traveled this is the variable
name we will choose here. And then cin days

19
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,460
traveled that’s the variable we are going
to read into. Now that we have the input from

20
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,109
the user so we ask the user to enter the number
of days they traveled. We read these days

21
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:05,890
into this variable now we should calculate
how many full weeks and what’s the remaining

22
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:12,680
days. So just as I spoke it the variable names
should be probably full weeks and remaining

23
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,000
days. So let’s declare two additional variables
one I would name full weeks. Note that I am

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,610
using this convention lower case f upper case
w. And remaining days once again lower case

25
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,420
r upper case d. You can also note that when
you declare more than one variable of the

26
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,630
same type you can do it in a single line of
code and separate the variables with a comma.

27
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,070
In this case I declared two variables in this
line both of them are of type int. One named

28
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,950
full weeks and the other remaining days. So
right here after we have the number of days

29
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,550
traveled in order to figure out the number
of full weeks we said we should div it by

30
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:04,530
7. So we do full weeks equals days traveled
div 7 right. That’s the number of full weeks

31
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:11,470
and the remaining days would be numbers of
days traveled mod 7. So remaining days equals

32
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,900
day traveled mod 7. So I am using the percent
sign here. So I have these values so now that

33
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:24,170
I have calculated the amount of full days
and how many days are remaining I can output

34
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:30,120
the message to the user cout. And I want it
to be in the format of in the case of the

35
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,470
input of 19 19 days or two weeks and five
days. So let’s start with days traveled

36
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:47,340
which would be our 19 and then days are which
would be full weeks as a string. And then

37
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,260
the remaining days days. After that we want
to break the line something like that. So

38
00:03:52,260 --> 00:04:00,110
we have in the case of the input of 19 19
days are two weeks and five days. This should

39
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,200
be fine let’s execute it and see if we need
to make some minor changes. So I am compiling

40
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,340
it I am just pressing the play button here.
And please enter the number of days you traveled.

41
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,850
I entered 19 and then it says 19 days are
two weeks and five days. There is a spacing

42
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:23,110
issue here and actually it makes sense because
we printed days traveled and then the text

43
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:29,770
days are with no spaces. So if we want to
space 19 and days we have to add a space over

44
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:37,169
here. We should also add a space here before
the two so there would be 19 space days space

45
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:45,300
are space and then two and then again we need
to add a space here and a space here and also

46
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,379
space here. Now it should look better let’s
execute it. Once again let’s enter the input

47
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:56,389
19 and then it would say 19 days are two weeks
and five days. Seems to work perfectly fine.

48
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,830
One last thing that I want to update here
is the use of 7 here. So as you can see we

49
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,550
have the variables days traveled full weeks
remaining days. They are all variables with

50
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,320
type int they are all data of type int they
are all integers. And then we use 7 here and

51
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,919
7 here are also integers because they are
C++ literals but this 7 is not an arbitrary

52
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:26,009
numbers. We use 7 because 7 is the number
of days in a week. A lot of times we prefer

53
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:31,599
to define our own constant to represent this
value. To make our code more clear. We typically

54
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:37,120
define constants above the main. We can define
it just next to the variables as well. Maybe

55
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,900
later on we will discuss what’s the difference
of the location where we define our variables

56
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,550
and constants. But for now let’s define
constants before the main. So up here I will

57
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,110
do constant int and now I want to define a
constant that the value would be 7. I am trying

58
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:58,490
to think what I should name this integer constant
and typically I choose the name by what it

59
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:04,509
represents by describe what it represents.
So 7 represents the number of days in a week.

60
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:11,449
For constants the common convention for constant
name is using all upper case and separating

61
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:18,500
t he words with underscore. So it would be
days in a week and then I would set it to

62
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,520
7. So not like variables where we define the
variable all lower case and separate the words

63
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,939
starting with the second one with upper case.
In constants we have a different naming convention

64
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:36,949
where we type the entire text as uppercase
and separates the words with underscore. So

65
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:42,960
days in a week equals 7 and then instead of
just typing 7 here I would just divide it

66
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,720
by days in a week and I would mod it by days
in a week. So when someone reads our code

67
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,129
now they can see that full weeks are basically
days traveled div the numbers of days in a

68
00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:00,949
week. And the remaining days are days traveled
mod the number of days in a week. There is

69
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:06,630
no supposed to be any effect on the execution
just instead of writing the literal 7 we define

70
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:13,650
our own constant with the value of 7. So here
when we type 19 we just get once again two

71
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,239
weeks then five days.
