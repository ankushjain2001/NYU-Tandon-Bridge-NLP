Hi there today we're going to talk about data
types and expressions in quite a detail.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:15,679
Before we do that I want to say that each
programming language has three fundamental

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,190
constructs.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,240
There are data expressions and a control flow.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,589
In order to master in a programming language
you have to know a lot in each one of them.

6
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:33,770
You have to know a lot in data a lot in expressions
a lot about control flow and actually takes

7
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,720
some time in order to understand so much.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,290
So we are going to take step by step and you
have to be kind of patient.
