Ok so we talked in quite a detail about the
int data type.

0:00:05.600,0:00:08.320
Let’s start talking about float and double.

0:00:08.320,0:00:15.730
These two types are quite similar to one another
so we will talk about both of them together.

0:00:15.730,0:00:19.600
And we will just say the small differences
between them are.

0:00:19.600,0:00:26.730
So float and doubles are used both to store
real numbers in them.

0:00:26.730,0:00:31.600
Real numbers meaning number that can have
fractional parts.

0:00:31.600,0:00:38.550
Let’s say 7.5 or 3.65 some decimal point
in them.

0:00:38.550,0:00:46.210
Let’s try and think about the inner representation
in of a data that can have fractional part.

0:00:46.210,0:00:52.569
So as integers both float and doubles also
have a fixed size it is not that their size

0:00:52.569,0:00:55.820
changes depending on the number they are represented.

0:00:55.820,0:01:00.190
Each float has a size of its own and each
double has a size of its own.

0:01:00.190,0:01:02.859
They differ from one another with their sizes.

0:01:02.859,0:01:10.719
So for doubles each double data takes 8 bytes
where each float data takes only 4 bytes.

0:01:10.719,0:01:17.600
So double is double the size of a float but
again each double data takes 8 bytes no matter

0:01:17.600,0:01:23.860
what’s represented in it and each float
data takes 4 bytes no matter what represented

0:01:23.860,0:01:24.360
in it.
