For example if we have an integer x and a
double y ints takes 4 bytes so x takes let’s

0:00:07.830,0:00:19.670
say from 100 to 104. And double y y is a double
so y takes 8 bytes from 104 to 112. If we

0:00:19.670,0:00:29.490
assign x with 6 and y with let’s say 7.658
so we are thinking that x would contain 6

0:00:29.490,0:00:37.620
and y would contain 7.658. But then we know
that it is not we really write the number

0:00:37.620,0:00:46.819
6 and the number 7.658 in the memory. So how
can we represent floating point numbers or

0:00:46.819,0:00:50.679
real numbers with fractional parts using zeroes
and ones.
