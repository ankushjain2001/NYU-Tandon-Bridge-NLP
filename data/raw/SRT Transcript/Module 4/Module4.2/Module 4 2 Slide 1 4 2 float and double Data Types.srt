0:00:00.200,0:00:09.330
So just for an example if we have x equals
6 and y equals 7.658 so we know that 6 is

0:00:09.330,0:00:14.769
represented in a 32 bit 2’s complement because
it is an integer and it would look like that.

0:00:14.769,0:00:21.250
Y or 7.658 would be represented using the
floating point representation method in case

0:00:21.250,0:00:27.090
of a double in a 64 bit and it would look
something like that.

0:00:27.090,0:00:33.140
And therefore it would be stored in y just
like that.

0:00:33.140,0:00:40.320
So this is the way doubles and floats are
basically represented using zeroes and ones.

0:00:40.320,0:00:46.150
Let’s talk about the built in datas that
are considered to be doubles and floats.

0:00:46.150,0:00:48.970
C++ literals of doubles and floats.

0:00:48.970,0:00:59.190
So for doubles we just write 3.4 -8.975 or
whatever decimal number we want to write.

0:00:59.190,0:01:03.640
If we want to write an integer number but
to be considered as double we have to write

0:01:03.640,0:01:11.850
6.0 to add a .0 to it if we just write 6 the
compiler would treat it as an integer.

0:01:11.850,0:01:19.600
If we want to write the double 6 as a C++
literal we just write it 6.0.

0:01:19.600,0:01:26.200
So for doubles we basically write the decimal
representation of real numbers.

0:01:26.200,0:01:32.909
For floats we just add a prefix of f at the
end of the numbers so the compiler would know

0:01:32.909,0:01:41.319
that when we write 3.4f it is the float literal
with a value of 3.4 and not the double literal

0:01:41.319,0:01:42.389
of 3.4.

0:01:42.389,0:01:47.399
That’s also for -8.975 and so on.

0:01:47.399,0:01:57.700
So that’s how we create C++ literals regarding
arithmetic operators in this case very very

0:01:57.700,0:01:58.810
expected.

0:01:58.810,0:02:02.729
We have a plus minus multiplication division.

0:02:02.729,0:02:10.539
In this case the slash operator would do real
division it won’t do div as it had in integers.

0:02:10.539,0:02:18.010
When we place divide operator between two
doubles or two floats it would make the real

0:02:18.010,0:02:22.790
division of these two values and assignment
as we have talked before.
