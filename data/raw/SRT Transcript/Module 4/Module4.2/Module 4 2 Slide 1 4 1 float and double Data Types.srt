0:00:00.710,0:00:07.819
One way of trying to do that is decide that
if we have let’s 8 bytes that the first

0:00:07.819,0:00:16.800
4 bytes would be for the integer part and
the other four bytes would be for the fractional

0:00:16.800,0:00:18.310
part.

0:00:18.310,0:00:23.970
And this is what we call like where we put
decimal point in a fixed position.

0:00:23.970,0:00:27.960
After four bytes we have fixed position for
the point.

0:00:27.960,0:00:33.670
This is not how doubles and float are really
represented inside the memory.

0:00:33.670,0:00:40.731
I am not going to get into the details of
the bits of how to represent floating point

0:00:40.731,0:00:49.320
numbers you can read in the following link
some more information about the floating points

0:00:49.320,0:00:53.960
representation method it is called IEEE 754.

0:00:53.960,0:01:02.890
But then I would say that the decimal point
it is not in a fixed position the point can

0:01:02.890,0:01:09.700
float around inside a bunch of bits that’s
why it is called the floating point representation

0:01:09.700,0:01:10.200
method.
