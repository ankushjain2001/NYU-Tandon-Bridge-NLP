0:00:00.659,0:00:06.629
Ok so we have integers we have float and doubles
we have char for a single character. The next

0:00:06.629,0:00:13.059
type I want to talk about is called string.
Actually the string type is not a built in

0:00:13.059,0:00:21.699
type in C++. In order to use the string type
we would need to include to extend our language

0:00:21.699,0:00:29.060
with the string library. So before using the
string type we have to pound include and then

0:00:29.060,0:00:37.660
string. Just as we’ve extended our language
for the c math and for the iostream things

0:00:37.660,0:00:46.160
that are not built in in C++ we use external
libraries to use this kind of syntax. Same

0:00:46.160,0:00:51.770
thing with string here since it is a very
useful type it is important for me to show

0:00:51.770,0:01:02.140
it to you right here in the beginning of your
experience with C++. So after including this

0:01:02.140,0:01:10.191
string class the data that is represented
using this type is a string or a text. In

0:01:10.191,0:01:14.950
a representation we won’t get too much into
the details maybe later modules we will talk

0:01:14.950,0:01:20.660
about strings in more detail. For now all
I want you to know is that strings are basically

0:01:20.660,0:01:29.560
sequences of characters just characters coming
up in the memory one after the other. Literals

0:01:29.560,0:01:39.830
built in C++ strings again not C++ but the
string library strings are quotes and then

0:01:39.830,0:01:45.840
a sequence of characters. So quote double
quotes ABC or double quotes this is a string

0:01:45.840,0:01:52.650
back slash each of them is of type string
or could be considered of type string though

0:01:52.650,0:02:00.340
formally they are not. Arithmetic operators
in this case there are plus and assignment.

0:02:00.340,0:02:06.480
Plus is a very useful operator that basically
concatenates string. Let’s see a few lines

0:02:06.480,0:02:13.600
of code to get the hang of this syntax. So
for example if we have an int variable x a

0:02:13.600,0:02:21.180
double variable y obviously we can assign
x with 5 and y with 7.3. In order to create

0:02:21.180,0:02:27.210
a string variable as we said first we need
to include string. And then we can declare

0:02:27.210,0:02:35.580
a string s variable and we can set it with
a literal for example hello. So s equals double

0:02:35.580,0:02:43.850
quote hello. We can then cout s that would
print hello and break the line endl. We can

0:02:43.850,0:02:51.910
also use the concatenation operator the plus
operator to for example cout s plus the string

0:02:51.910,0:02:58.840
world. So s is a string double quotes word
is a string and we can add a string to a string

0:02:58.840,0:03:05.120
that would concatenate the text. So we would
print hello world back slash or in this case

0:03:05.120,0:03:13.680
enter. We can also assign s with s plus world
that would turn s instead of having text hello

0:03:13.680,0:03:19.380
the string hello to have the string hello
world. Then we can cout s that would print

0:03:19.380,0:03:25.760
hello world. So it is a very easy syntax to
use but then it is very useful because there

0:03:25.760,0:03:32.980
is a lot of programs would need to communicate
with humans and strings and texts are the

0:03:32.980,0:03:33.480
way to do that.
