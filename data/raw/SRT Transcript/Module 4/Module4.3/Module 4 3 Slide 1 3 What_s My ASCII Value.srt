Let’s try to write a program that reads
from the user a single character and then

0:00:07.140,0:00:12.570
prints what’s the ASCII value that corresponds
to that character.

0:00:12.570,0:00:17.830
For example the program would first ask the
user please enter a character the user would

0:00:17.830,0:00:24.359
say upper case T and then the program would
respond by saying the ASCII value of upper

0:00:24.359,0:00:26.670
case T is 84.
