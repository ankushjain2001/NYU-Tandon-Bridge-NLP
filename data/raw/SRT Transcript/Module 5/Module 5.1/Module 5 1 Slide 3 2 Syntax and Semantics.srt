0:00:00.470,0:00:06.709
Okay, so in order to use the if else statement,
the two-way IF statement, the syntax would

0:00:06.709,0:00:11.450
go this way; once again, I'll first talk about
the syntax, then show you the semantics for

0:00:11.450,0:00:15.490
how the compiler understands this kind of
statements.

0:00:15.490,0:00:21.970
So, the syntax is very simple it goes like
that; we have our program, then comes the

0:00:21.970,0:00:27.669
if keyword followed by a Boolean expression
and enclosed in parenthesis, and then we have

0:00:27.669,0:00:32.419
the if body, again pushed one tab to the right.

0:00:32.419,0:00:38.550
After that we have the ELSE keyword and else's
body pushed one tab to the right, after the

0:00:38.550,0:00:43.770
if else statement the program just continues
in its original alignment.

0:00:43.770,0:00:45.580
That's basically the syntax.

0:00:45.580,0:00:54.620
The semantics is very straightforward here
as well, so when we get to the if else statement,

0:00:54.620,0:00:57.870
the first thing is the condition is evaluated.

0:00:57.870,0:01:04.890
As we said the condition is a Boolean expression,
so it has two values possible either its value

0:01:04.890,0:01:06.530
is true or false.

0:01:06.530,0:01:12.220
In case the condition is true, the if body
would be executed and then the program would

0:01:12.220,0:01:14.990
continue in its original execution.

0:01:14.990,0:01:20.280
But if the condition would be false then the
else's body would be executed followed by

0:01:20.280,0:01:24.229
the execution of the rest of the program.

0:01:24.229,0:01:31.770
So basically based on the value of the Boolean
expression, we either evaluate the IF body

0:01:31.770,0:01:33.369
or the else body.

0:01:33.369,0:01:39.170
That's why it's called the two way if statement;
we either go one way with the IF body or the

0:01:39.170,0:01:44.260
other way with the Else body, based on the
value of the Boolean expression, based on

0:01:44.260,0:01:47.260
the value of this condition.

0:01:47.260,0:01:53.740
Once again this is the simplified version
of the if else; if we want to use the more

0:01:53.740,0:02:01.790
compound version, where we want to execute
a few of instructions, a set of instructions

0:02:01.790,0:02:10.479
in the true case, and the set of instructions
in the false case, then we need to compound

0:02:10.479,0:02:14.690
or to group together a set of instructions
using curly braces.

0:02:14.690,0:02:20.840
So, after the if in the condition we can have
a set of instructions enclosed in curly braces

0:02:20.840,0:02:25.620
as after the else we can have a set of instructions
enclosed in curly braces.
