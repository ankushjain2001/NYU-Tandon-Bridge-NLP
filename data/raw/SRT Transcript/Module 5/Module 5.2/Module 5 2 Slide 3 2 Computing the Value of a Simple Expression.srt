0:00:00.500,0:00:06.580
So let's try to use a switch in order to solve
of the following problem.

0:00:06.580,0:00:11.470
Let's write a program that reads from the
user a simple mathematical expression.

0:00:11.470,0:00:18.240
We will allow only an addition difference
division or multiplication expression and

0:00:18.240,0:00:20.360
then we'll print the value.

0:00:20.360,0:00:26.340
For example, the user would be prompted to
enter an expression of the form argument operator

0:00:26.340,0:00:33.730
argument, and then the user would say I don't
know five point two times four and the program

0:00:33.730,0:00:39.730
would respond by saying twenty point eight
which is five point two times four.

0:00:39.730,0:00:43.460
Let's try to implement this program using
switch.

0:00:43.460,0:00:50.260
Now we don't really need to use switch here
we can definitely use the if-else statement

0:00:50.260,0:00:57.989
or other kind of branching statements, but
let's try to use switch anyway.

0:00:57.989,0:00:59.120
Let's go ahead.
