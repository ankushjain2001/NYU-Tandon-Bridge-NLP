00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:01,710
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,540
Today we will start discussing the computer
organization section of this course.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,300
We will learn about the innerworkings of the
CPU that allows it to execute its instructions

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,530
and we will discuss different methods to optimize
CPU performance.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,360
So this is the outline for today.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,020
We will go over instruction types and formats,
which are critical in determining how instructions

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,020
are executed.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,170
We will then detail the execution steps for
a small processor that we will design.

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,870
We will then discuss processor clock rate
to estimate how fast our processor is, and

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,440
go over processor pipelining, its benefits,
and the issues it presents.
