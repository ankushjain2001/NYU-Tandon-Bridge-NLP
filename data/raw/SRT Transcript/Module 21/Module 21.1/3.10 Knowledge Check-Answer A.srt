1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,800
Remember.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,580
Since only one instruction uses the CPU at
a time, we don't get resource conflicts or

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,870
structural hazards in a unpipelined CPU.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,620
Moreover, since each instruction completes
before the next one is fetched, we donâ€™t

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,039
get dependency issues or data hazards, as
well as branch taken/not taken issues or branch

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,310
hazards.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,060
So there are no branch hazards in an unpipelined
CPU.
