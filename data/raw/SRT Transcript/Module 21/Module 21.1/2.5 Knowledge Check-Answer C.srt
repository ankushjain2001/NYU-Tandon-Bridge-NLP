1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,090
Here you used the wrong formula to calculate
the target address.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,680
Remember, the first part of the formula is
to increment PC by 4.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,040
But remember, for this question, the CPU just
completed the fetch step.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,039
So it doesn't yet know that it is doing a
branch instruction.
