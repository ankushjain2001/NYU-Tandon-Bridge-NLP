00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,210
Let us consider the following example.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,950
Given two instructions load double and double
word add, our CPU will do the following.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,639
It will first execute the load double instruction.

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,960
That is, it will go to states 0, 1, 2 3, and
4, requiring 5 cycles to complete.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,510
Then the CPU transitions to state zero to
start executing the double word add instruction.

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:33,840
Since doubleword add takes 4 clock cycles,
the two instructions require 9 cycles to complete.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,980
This type of CPU that can only execute one
instruction at a time is called an unpipelined

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,120
CPU.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,239
The opposite is called a pipelined CPU.
