1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:01,849
OK.

2
00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:05,730
Now, we are going to the steps the processor
go through when executing instructions.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,010
We will use the example of building a processor
to illustrate these steps.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,590
Our processor is based on MIPS64 and has only
7 instructions.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:22,230
Our CPU can execute four R-format instructions:
D ADD, D SUB, D OR and D AND.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,320
It can execute Load double and store double,
as well as branch if equal to zero.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,540
When executing an instruction, a CPU generally
goes through the following steps: instruction

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,050
fetch, instruction decode, instruction execute,
memory, and WriteBack.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,370
During instruction fetch, the CPU reads the
instruction from memory to determine what

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,809
it is.

11
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:48,979
The CPU uses the program counter to determine
the address of the instruction in memory.

12
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:54,489
During decode, the CPU determines the format
of the fetched instruction, the operation

13
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,670
the instruction is supposed to do, and gets
its operands.

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,179
The execute step performs the operation of
the instruction.

15
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,750
The processor goes through a memory step if
the instruction needs to do a data memory

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,750
access.

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:14,140
For example, a store instruction would go
through the memory step.

18
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,039
The processor goes through a WriteBack step
if the instruction needs to write the result

19
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,859
of its operation in a general purpose register.

20
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:26,580
For example, the DADD instruction needs to
write the result of its addition to the destination

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,310
register and must go through the WriteBack
step.

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,790
As we can see, an instruction may not go through
all the steps we have described.

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,009
However, each instruction goes through the
fetch decode and execute stages.
