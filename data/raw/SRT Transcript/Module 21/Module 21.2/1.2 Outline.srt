Hi everyone, today we will cover the second
part of the computer organization section

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,040
of this course.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,549
We will focus on the memory hierarchy, which
is one of the most important aspects of CPU

00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:12,549
design.

00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:16,190
We will discuss the need for caches, which
are smaller memory components between the

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,320
CPU and the main memory, how they are organized
and how they facilitate faster access to code

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,609
