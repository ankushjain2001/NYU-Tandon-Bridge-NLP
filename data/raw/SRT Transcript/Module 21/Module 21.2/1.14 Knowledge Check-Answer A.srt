1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:01,789
That is correct.

2
00:00:01,789 --> 00:00:06,440
In a fully associative cache, the new DRAM
block can go anywhere in the cache as long

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,170
as there is a free block.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,139
So regardless of the replacement policy, if
there is a cache block that is available,

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,000
the DRAM block is put in that available cache
block.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,090
In our example, the 32nd block is free
