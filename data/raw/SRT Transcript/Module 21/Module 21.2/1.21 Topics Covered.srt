1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,380
We have covered memory hierarchy.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,170
We discussed the main limitations of D RAM
with respect to access delay and how it can

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,440
have a significant degradation on performance.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,790
To overcome this delay, we discuss how caches
can be used.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,730
We highlighted the principles of temporal
and spatial locality of caches and how they

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,960
can be organized to keep frequently used data
and instructions closer to the CPU in order

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,190
to reduce access delay.
