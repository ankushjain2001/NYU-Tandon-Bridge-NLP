00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,360
The primary approach to overcome the main
memory access delay is by adding caches.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,309
A cache is another memory component that is
put between the main memory and the processor

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:15,019
core and its role is to hold instructions
and data that the CPU often uses.

4
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:18,030
So what makes a cache different from DRAM?

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,120
First off, a cache is implemented as SRAM
instead of DRAM.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,700
The S in SRAM stands for static.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,840
This means that there is no need to refresh
the main memory, which makes it faster to

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,950
read from and write to.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,150
However, SRAM requires more space to hold
one bit of data than DRAM.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:43,080
Usually, SRAM can require up to 8 times more
area to store one bit than a DRAM.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,610
So, although it consumes less power, SRAM
takes more area.

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,630
As a result, we canâ€™t have gigabytes worth
of SRAM.

13
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,090
Usually, an SRAM cache is in the range of
2KB to 2-MB.

14
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,170
Given that a cache can be in the kilobyte
size, it is small enough that it can be put

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,610
on the same chip as the CPU without it consuming
all of the power budget.

16
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,540
So with the benefits of using static RAM and
being able to put the cache on the same chip

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:16,480
as the CPU, the access delay of a cache can
be between 1 and 12 cycles depending on the

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,580
size and other factors that we will discuss.

19
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,640
Now someone may have the intuition to simply
use SRAM for main memory instead of DRAM.

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,439
But remember, SRAM can require up to 8 more
area than DRAM.

21
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,430
Therefore, you cannot have a large 8 GB main
memory as SRAM because it will take too much

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,859
space on your computer motherboard.
