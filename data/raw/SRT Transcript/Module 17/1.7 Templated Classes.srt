00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,930
There's a little bit of extra work to be done
when we template a class.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,860
So when we template the class, the name of
the class actually changes to incorporate

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,130
the template.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,340
So here I've got a simple description of a
class called “sum valve.”

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,450
Where we've templated it to store a simple
data item and this is leading up to what a

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,250
linked list node would look like and we'll
get to that in a later slide.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:32,559
But basically the sum val class stores one
data item, and it's got a function for get

8
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,360
val and for set val, and we don't know what
the T data type is and really we don't care

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,530
what’s the T data type.

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,450
And now inside main what we do is we’d create
this as sum val int and that's where you've

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,880
seen before, that's where a vector comes from.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,579
So you've done this before with vector and
now you understand why; it's because vector

13
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:52,910
is templated.

14
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,671
So we have to tell it what data type we're
working with inside the sum val object, so

15
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:05,590
when we create it we say sum val int var name
or sum val char var name or sum val whatever

16
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:12,450
var name and you're giving it a data type
to now store inside some val.

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,340
Now the one thing to take notice of here,
is that every function that we create has

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,479
to be templated.

19
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,100
So the set Val function, for example, has
to be a templated function because first off

20
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:32,360
it has a parameter of type T. But also because
the class name is now changed to some value

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,869
less than T greater than.

22
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,649
So we can see that the actual name of the,
of the class changes to incorporate the data

23
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:40,649
type.

24
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:44,899
And that's just an internal C++ representation
but we do have to take note of that for any

25
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:48,399
time we're going to work with a templated
function inside of a templated class.
