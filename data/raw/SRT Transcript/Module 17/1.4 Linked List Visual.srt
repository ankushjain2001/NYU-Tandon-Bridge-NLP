1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:04,450
So what you can see here is a visual representation
of the linked list.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,790
We have a head pointer that points at the
first note and inside the node there is an

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,270
object called a data section and the next
pointer the next pointer points at the next

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,270
node.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,110
So the pointers are all the same pointers;
theyâ€™re list node pointers.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,230
That's really what we're going to see later
on in this and this module.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,630
So the objects that are being stored are whatever
data type you'd like, we'll see how to do

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,369
that later with templates, whatever data type
you'd like.

9
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,729
And we have this head pointer that points
at the first node, the next pointer points

10
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:37,190
the second node, the next pointer the second
node points at the third node, and the next

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,079
pointer of the third node points at null.

12
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,149
So there's three nodes on this list.

13
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:44,579
There's three data items on this list you
can call them: one, two, and three, if they

14
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,670
were integers, and you can store in them whatever
integer you want.

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,839
Now this list might also have a tail pointer
to point at the last node and that's functionally

16
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:56,819
dependent on what we decide to do with this
linked list.

17
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:00,929
So, we may end up needing a tail pointer and
if we do then we can have that as well to

18
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,920
point to the last node in the list.

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,619
And that's just for easy access if, for example,
we want to expand on the list by adding a

20
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,260
node then we can do that easily through the
tail pointer or through the head pointer.
