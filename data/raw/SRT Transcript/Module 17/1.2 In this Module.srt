1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,270
In this module, we're going to learn about
linked lists and what a linked list is and

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,649
why we need linked lists.

3
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:10,230
And then we're going to talk about templates
for classes and functions, so that we can

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,220
work with any data type.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,270
And then we're going to talk about how a linked
list is designed and what we use linked lists

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,270
for.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,949
And we're going to use linked list extensively
for the rest of the semester here.

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,300
In the later modules, you're going to see
a lot of implementations of linked list; so

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,239
we just want you to have a background for
understanding what a linked list is and how

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,009
you would use it and when you would work with
it.
