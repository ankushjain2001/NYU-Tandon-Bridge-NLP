1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
Okay.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,620
So, let's use this technique in order to prove
the following claim.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:11,450
Weâ€™ll show that for any natural number N:
two N square plus five N minus six is greater

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,170
or equal to zero.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,140
Let's go ahead and prove it.
