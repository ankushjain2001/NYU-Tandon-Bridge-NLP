1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,379
Let’s show that every natural number can
be written as a power of two times an odd

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,379
number.

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:10,830
Once again you can see that this statement
is of the form for any natural number some

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,460
P of N is true; this is our P of N and know
that N can be written in some form.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,870
Let's go ahead and prove it.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,800
Actually before we start proving using strong
induction, let's see that just the regular

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,410
mathematical induction can't really help us
here.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,600
So, in regular induction we would probably
say that we assume that P of N minus one is

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,080
true or basically N minus one can be written
in the form of two to the power of some I

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,930
times an odd number J, so let's assume we
have that.

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,710
And given that, we should show that N is also
some power of two times an odd number.

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,930
The only straightforward way I'm thinking
of combining N with N minus one is just adding

13
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:56,430
one to it, but then if N minus one is two
to the I times J, if I'll add one to it, I

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,430
won't get something of the form some power
of I times J. But then if we know that this

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,300
thing is true, not only for N minus one but
for all other values of N.

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,530
For example, I know that N is two times N
by two.

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,310
So, if I know that N by two, for example,
is two times two to the power of I times J,

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,810
then N would be two times two to the power
of I times J, which would be some power of

19
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,800
two times an odd number.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,930
So, using the assumption on a smaller value
than N minus one, in this case N by two, seems

21
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,090
to be helpful more than using the assumption
of N minus one.

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,130
That's why a strong induction here is better.

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,140
Let's use a strong induction to show exactly
that.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,140
Okay.

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,941
So, a proof will prove by a strong induction
on N. And once again, we have two steps: the

26
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,340
base and inductive step.

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,340
So for the base, we should show that P of
one is true.

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:01,070
So, for any cause one, we should show how
we can represent one as some power of two

29
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,440
times an odd number.

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,390
So, that's very easy cause one is two to the
zero times one.

31
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,721
So, if we take our power of two to be zero,
the exponent to be zero, and our odd number

32
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:20,180
to be one we get that one is basically two
to the zero times one, just as requested.

33
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,410
And now, let's do the inductive step.

34
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,709
In this case, we should assume that P of N
is true for any value smaller than N. And

35
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:32,340
using that assumption, we should show that
P of N is true, so let's have this assumption

36
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,340
ready.

37
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:41,520
So we assume that every K smaller than N can
be written in the form of K equals two to

38
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,960
some power of I times J, where obviously I
is a non-negative integer and J is odd.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,500
So, this is our assumption; it's cement.

40
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,570
And now we show that N itself can also be
written in this form.

41
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:03,430
Now we show that N can be written as two to
the power of I times J, obviously other I's

42
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,440
and J’s here, with I and J as described.

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,610
So, this is what we need to show.

44
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,300
So, we’ll use this assumption here in order
to show that N can be represented this way

45
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,400
and this assumption is for every value of
K; for K equals N minus one, N minus two,

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,860
N minus three, and so on.

47
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,570
Also for K equals N by two, which would be
the value of K that we would like to use this

48
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,570
assumption on.

49
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,790
Yeah, so let's do that.

50
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:34,500
The only thing is that we need to take care,
or in other words, not every N has an integer

51
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,380
N by two; odd numbers you can't really divide
by two and get another integer value after

52
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,380
this division.

53
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,410
So, let's separate to the two cases when our
N is odd and when it's even and do all of

54
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,410
that.

55
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,819
So, we have two cases to take care of: the
first is that N is odd; the second is that

56
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:53,819
N is even.

57
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,740
So, for the second case that's the main part
of this proof is when we're going to use the

58
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,040
inductive assumption on N by two.

59
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,120
The first case is quite easy when N is odd,
obviously you can represent it as a power

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,470
of two times an odd number, just take the
power of two to be zero, so it would be one

61
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,680
times N itself.

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,759
So, in this case, if we take I to be zero
and J to be N, we get that N equals two to

63
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:26,159
the power of zero times N, which is obviously
N, and I and J are as requested; so, we're

64
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,159
fine.

65
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:31,770
In the case where N is even, now we're going
to do what we basically said we'll do here

66
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,889
in this case.

67
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:40,290
Since N by two is less than N, by the inductive
hypothesis, if we take K to be N by two, we

68
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:46,009
get that N by two is then equal to two to
the power of two to the power of some, let's

69
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:53,849
say, I prime times J prime for our non-negative
I prime and all J prime.

70
00:04:53,849 --> 00:05:01,209
And now we can, given that, we can present
N in other requested form.
