00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,040
Let's use the strong induction technique to
prove some claim.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:12,030
So let's show that every natural number N
can be written in the form of two to the power

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,090
of I times J, where I is a non-negative integer
and J is odd.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:23,750
Basically, we’ll try to show that N can
be written as a power of two times an odd

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,750
number.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,800
For example, forty: we can write forty as
two to the power of three, which is eight,

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
times five.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,970
So, it's a power of two with the non-negative
integer exponent times an odd number.

9
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:45,360
That is true, we should show it not only for
forty but for all natural number N.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,361
For example, for six: six can be written as
two to the power of one times three, and seven,

11
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:56,100
for example, can be written as two to the
power of zero times seven.

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,830
And we’ll show that any number, any natural
number, can be written in this form: some

13
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,570
power of two with a non-negative exponent
times an odd number.

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,300
Let's go ahead and show it.
