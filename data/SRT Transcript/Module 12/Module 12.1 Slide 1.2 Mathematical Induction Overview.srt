Hi there, hope you're having a great day.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,900
Today we're going to talk about recursions;
recursions are basically a very powerful problem

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,390
solving technique that we're going to explore
and see how it works.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,960
But before we do that, let's talk a bit about
mathematical induction.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,630
I know the two are very related to one another;
there is a very close relationship between

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,900
mathematical induction and recursion.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,910
Iâ€™m not sure exactly how much you're familiar
with mathematical induction so let me do a

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,730
short overview of mathematical induction.

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:42,940
First, so methodical Induction is a technique
to prove statements; it's a mathematical technique

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,330
to prove statements.

11
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:53,230
Basically it's used to prove universal statements
that are of the form P of N is true for any

12
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,329
natural number.

13
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,370
So, for all of the natural numbers P of N
is true.

14
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:05,019
This is the form of statements we use mathematical
induction proving technique.

15
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,979
When we prove using mathematical inductions
or there are basically two steps in our proof:

16
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:14,079
there is the base case and there is the inductive
step.

17
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,900
In the base case, we typically prove that
P of one is true, that our statement is true

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,000
for the smallest natural number for one P
of one is true, that's the thing we do in

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,840
our base case.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,630
In the inductive step, we show that P of N
minus one implies P of N.

21
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,280
So, if we know P of N minus one is true, we
can also show that P of N is true too.

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,079
And we show this statement P of N minus one
implies P of N for any natural number greater

23
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,689
than or equal to two.

24
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:57,219
When we use these two steps to prove a universal
statement as we said, basically we're not

25
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:03,709
showing in a straightforward manner that P
of N is true for all natural numbers but we

26
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:11,830
say that after proving the base case and the
inductive step we can conclude that P of N

27
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,780
is true for all natural numbers.

28
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,060
And let's get convinced that these two steps
basically imply that P of N is true for any

29
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,379
natural number.

30
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,560
So, let's see what we've proved and what conclusions
can we make out of it.

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,390
So, obviously when we prove that P of one
is true we can say that P of one is true.

32
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:39,400
But then we also prove that P of one implies
P of two, now since we already know that one

33
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,599
is true, this implication would lead that
P of two is also true.

34
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:51,800
And we've proved this P of N. minus one implies
P of N, not only for one and two but for any

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,969
natural number so we also prove that P of
two implies P of three given that we already

36
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,870
have concluded P of two is true.

37
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,970
These two together would lead us to say that
P of three is true and once again P of three

38
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,040
implies P or four and P of three is true,
so P of four is also true and this keeps on

39
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
going.

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,159
And that way we can just say that P of one,
P of two, P of three, P of four, or basically

41
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,870
any P. of N for all natural numbers are true.

42
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,849
That's like the bases of mathematical induction.
