00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:07,920
Let's talk about a variation, a more general
form of induction, called strong induction.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,339
Strong induction is also a mathematical technique
to prove universal statements of the same

3
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:19,340
form, P of N is true for any natural number
N, but then the technique is a bit different.

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,520
This technique also has two steps: the base
case and the inductive step.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,580
Base case, same as the regular mathematical
induction, we prove that P of one is true.

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:38,940
But the inductive step would be a bit different:
in regular induction we just prove that a

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:47,620
P of N minus one implies P of N, in the strong
induction we prove that if P is true for all

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,170
values more than N, that implies that P of
N is true.

9
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,539
So, our assumption here is stronger instead
of just assuming P of N minus one and using

10
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:05,820
that a single assumption to prove that P of
N is true, here we assume that P is true for

11
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,390
all values smaller than N. Basically that
P of N minus one is true, and P of N minus

12
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:16,001
two is true, and P of N minus three is true
and all values of P are true up to N; all

13
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:19,390
of that together should imply that P of N
is true.

14
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:25,369
We have a much stronger assumption here to
show that P of N is true; that's why it's

15
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:27,899
named strong induction.

16
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:33,840
Let's see why this technique basically can
be used in order to show that P of N is true

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,250
for all natural numbers N.

18
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,829
So, once again we prove that P of one is true,
in our base case, that means that we can conclude

19
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:44,609
that P of one and is true.

20
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:51,860
And then we show that P of one implies P of
two all values smaller than two are true,

21
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:58,060
basically P of one, means P of two is true
by showing this statement using the fact that

22
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,899
P of one is already true, we can conclude
that P. of two is true.

23
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:09,009
Then we also show that if P of one and P of
two are true, then P three is true.

24
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:14,010
Our assumption, the stronger assumption for
P of three was that all values smaller than

25
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,459
three are true; P of one and two are true.

26
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:22,640
That implies P of three is true and, in this
point of time, we already know that P of one

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,540
is true and that P of two is also true.

28
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,010
And therefore, we can say that P of three
is true.

29
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,610
Moving on, we showed that P of one, P of two,
and P of three, all of them together are true

30
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,629
that implies P of four.

31
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:42,129
Again, we already know that P of one and P
of two and P of three are all true.

32
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:46,730
Therefore, we can say safely that P of four
is true.

33
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:53,810
I believe you see that these things can go
on, and that way we basically show that all

34
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,560
P of N’s are true for all natural number
N’s.
