0:00:00.120,0:00:01.120
Okay.

0:00:01.120,0:00:05.700
So we start by reading the number of students
from the user, and then we ask the user to

0:00:05.700,0:00:07.299
enter the grades.

0:00:07.299,0:00:14.299
Then we do number of student iterations in
order to first read each grade but then, we

0:00:14.299,0:00:16.270
also want to accumulate the sum.

0:00:16.270,0:00:21.670
So, for that we have our accumulating variable
sum that is first initialized to zero before

0:00:21.670,0:00:27.790
starting to iterate and then after each time
we read a grade, we also add it to this accumulation

0:00:27.790,0:00:29.580
variable, we add it into sum.

0:00:29.580,0:00:36.600
So, when this ‘for’ loop ends we have
the total sum of the grades in our sum variable.

0:00:36.600,0:00:41.670
So we can just divide sum by the number of
students and get the average.

0:00:41.670,0:00:46.540
After doing that, all we have left is just
outputting this average back to the user.
