0:00:00.550,0:00:06.640
Now that we have the definition of what k
combinations are letâ€™s try to write a program

0:00:06.640,0:00:11.400
that reads from the user two positive integers
n and k.

0:00:11.400,0:00:13.831
Assuming that k is not greater than n.

0:00:13.831,0:00:16.939
And it would print the value of n choose k.

0:00:16.939,0:00:19.680
So an execution can look something like that.

0:00:19.680,0:00:23.159
First we would ask the user to enter n and
k.

0:00:23.159,0:00:27.789
The user can say five and three for example
and then the program would respond by saying

0:00:27.789,0:00:30.129
five choose three is ten.
