0:00:00.280,0:00:10.599
So to put it in context you can see that functions
are a new way of a control flow.

0:00:10.599,0:00:15.990
So if like we have the sequential flow that
our instructions are executed one after the

0:00:15.990,0:00:18.750
other in a sequential order.

0:00:18.750,0:00:26.300
Then we introduced branching where we could
some executions do one lines of code and another

0:00:26.300,0:00:30.550
execution jump to do a different set of instructions.

0:00:30.550,0:00:35.399
Iterative statements that allow us to repeat
the same instructions over and over.

0:00:35.399,0:00:40.300
To jump back to a position weâ€™ve already
been in our code and execute the instructions

0:00:40.300,0:00:41.719
over and over.

0:00:41.719,0:00:50.969
Function calls are none of these control flows
are a different order that we are executing

0:00:50.969,0:00:52.199
our instructions.

0:00:52.199,0:00:56.719
When we call a function we jump to a totally
new position in our code.

0:00:56.719,0:00:59.949
Do or execute the instructions over there.

0:00:59.949,0:01:05.140
And when the function ends using a return
statement we are jumping back to where we

0:01:05.140,0:01:06.140
came from.

0:01:06.140,0:01:12.909
So that is a totally new control flow and
in order to get a bit deeper understanding

0:01:12.909,0:01:17.409
of what is going on inside the computer there.

0:01:17.409,0:01:26.619
Let me introduce you to an execution model
named the run time stack.

0:01:26.619,0:01:31.809
And that is basically what happens inside
of the computer during the execution time.
