0:00:00.510,0:00:05.180
One last thing we have to do here is just
implement a linear function that is very easy.

0:00:05.180,0:00:10.120
So in case we have an equation A x plus B
equals zero.

0:00:10.120,0:00:17.800
So basically if A is not zero we can safely
say that the solution would be again move

0:00:17.800,0:00:25.949
B to the other hand of the equation and divide
by A so X would be negative B over A. And

0:00:25.949,0:00:30.850
then we’ll set out x to be x and return
one real solution.

0:00:30.850,0:00:38.069
In case both A and B are zero that means that
all reals are solutions.

0:00:38.069,0:00:45.989
In this case I’ve also updated out x to
be zero just as an example of A solution.

0:00:45.989,0:00:55.100
And otherwise basically meaning that it is
not or A is not different than zero it is

0:00:55.100,0:00:56.100
zero.

0:00:56.100,0:00:58.799
But it is not the case that both A and B are
zeroes.

0:00:58.799,0:01:07.110
So A is zero and B is not zero in this case
we have zero x plus b equals zero there aren’t

0:01:07.110,0:01:08.110
solutions there.

0:01:08.110,0:01:10.290
It’s like zero x plus five equals zero.

0:01:10.290,0:01:12.230
So in this case we just return no solutions.
