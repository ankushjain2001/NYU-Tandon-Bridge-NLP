0:00:00.410,0:00:02.940
Let’s add another function here.

0:00:02.940,0:00:05.229
Linear just as we had quadratic.

0:00:05.229,0:00:10.879
The input for the linear would be actually
linear has two coefficients so we would have

0:00:10.879,0:00:13.759
double A and double B right.

0:00:13.759,0:00:19.910
And the linear function should return the
type of solution right maybe all reals we

0:00:19.910,0:00:21.350
said in case of a linear.

0:00:21.350,0:00:25.780
There could be no solution at all or no real
solution or both of the times actually there

0:00:25.780,0:00:28.369
is only one solution for linear equation.

0:00:28.369,0:00:31.160
A x plus B equals zero.

0:00:31.160,0:00:35.890
So just move the B divide by A and get one
real solution.

0:00:35.890,0:00:42.450
So let’s have the solution as an output
parameter and the type of solution as a return

0:00:42.450,0:00:43.450
value.

0:00:43.450,0:00:49.460
Let’s document this function so linear first
we say what is it intended to do so it solves

0:00:49.460,0:00:53.510
a linear equation of the type A x plus B equals
zero.

0:00:53.510,0:00:58.199
The input are A and B which are the coefficients
of the solution.

0:00:58.199,0:01:04.300
And the output is the type of the solution
as a return value and out x one that is the

0:01:04.300,0:01:10.970
solution of the solution of an equation or
a solution of an equation as an output parameter.

0:01:10.970,0:01:19.250
Our assumption here is obviously if there
aren’t any solutions then out x one is not

0:01:19.250,0:01:19.870
defined.
