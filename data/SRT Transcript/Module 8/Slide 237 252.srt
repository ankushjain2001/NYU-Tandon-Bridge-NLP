Ok as a final example let’s write a program
that solves a quadratic equation. Let’s

0:00:09.200,0:00:14.150
write a program that basically reads three
real numbers representing the coefficients

0:00:14.150,0:00:20.780
of a quadratic equation. And then it prints
the solutions of the equation if there are

0:00:20.780,0:00:28.170
any or an appropriate message. So for example
an execution could look something like please

0:00:28.170,0:00:35.100
enter coefficients of the quadratic equation.
The user says one negative five and six. And

0:00:35.100,0:00:43.719
then the program would say the equation one
x squared just uses this symbol to says power

0:00:43.719,0:00:52.589
up. So one x squared plus negative five x
plus six equals zero solutions two and three.

0:00:52.589,0:01:01.739
In this case there are two solutions. So before
we go to implement this program let’s go

0:01:01.739,0:01:07.890
back to I don’t know seventh eighth grade
where we’ve talked about quadratic equations

0:01:07.890,0:01:14.570
and make sure that we got the math all figured
out. All the observations how to solve quadratic

0:01:14.570,0:01:23.100
equations. So we know that we have this formula
in case our equation A x squared plus B x

0:01:23.100,0:01:32.070
plus C equals zero and it is a real quadratic
equation. So A is not zero. Then we have an

0:01:32.070,0:01:42.430
equation for the square root of these of the
solutions of these x sub one and two are negative

0:01:42.430,0:01:50.450
B plus minus the square root of B squared
minus four A C over two A. See why it is important

0:01:50.450,0:01:58.960
that A is not zero so we can divide by two
times A. So this formula here is fine only

0:01:58.960,0:02:06.620
when it is a real quadratic equation. And
basically there could be different types of

0:02:06.620,0:02:15.569
solutions basically depending on the sign
of the discriminant. So in case B squared

0:02:15.569,0:02:22.900
minus four A C is positive there could be
two real solutions here. For example a one

0:02:22.900,0:02:28.319
negative five and six x squared minus five
x plus six equals zero. We have two solutions

0:02:28.319,0:02:35.269
x one and x two. But then if the discriminant
is zero then when we take the square root

0:02:35.269,0:02:41.099
it would also be zero and the plus minus zero
would be the same. So for that case we would

0:02:41.099,0:02:47.569
have only one solution. For example when A
is one B is two and C is three you can check

0:02:47.569,0:02:52.870
that B squared minus four A C would be zero
and then we would get only one solution. X

0:02:52.870,0:03:01.010
equals negative one. And there are also cases
where the discriminant is negative in this

0:03:01.010,0:03:09.209
case there is no square root real square root.
So there is no real solution so we say that

0:03:09.209,0:03:17.200
in this case there is no real solution. For
example when A is one B is zero and C is one

0:03:17.200,0:03:24.469
you will see that B squared minus four A C
is a negative. In this case there is no real

0:03:24.469,0:03:31.480
solution there are complex solutions but no
real solutions. So so far for quadratic equations

0:03:31.480,0:03:38.829
we either have two real solutions one real
solution or no real solutions at all. But

0:03:38.829,0:03:46.900
when we are reading these A B and C we are
not guaranteed that A would be not zero. There

0:03:46.900,0:03:57.779
are cases where A could be zero. In these
cases the solutions can also be a bit different.

0:03:57.779,0:04:04.739
So for example if A is zero B is zero and
C is five so we get a zero x squared plus

0:04:04.739,0:04:13.109
zero x plus five equals zero basically five
equals zero no value substitute for x to get

0:04:13.109,0:04:20.769
like a truth statement here. So in this case
there is no solution at all not only not a

0:04:20.769,0:04:27.250
real solution and you do have a complex solution.
There would be no solution at all right. Or

0:04:27.250,0:04:35.530
if all A B and Cs are zeroes so you’ll get
zero equals zero basically all values you’ll

0:04:35.530,0:04:41.311
substitute for x would give you a truth statement.
So for zero zero zero for example you would

0:04:41.311,0:04:49.949
get that all reals are solutions. So let’s
use these observations so there are five types

0:04:49.949,0:04:56.389
of different solutions either two real solutions
one real solution no real solution at all

0:04:56.389,0:05:05.580
no solutions at all or that all the reals
are solutions. Now that we’ve refreshed

0:05:05.580,0:05:08.500
that let’s go ahead and implement this program.
