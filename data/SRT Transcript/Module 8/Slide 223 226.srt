Let’s try to write another program.

0:00:02.600,0:00:09.830
Let’s write a program that reads a positive
integer num and prints both the numbers of

0:00:09.830,0:00:12.200
digits in num how many digits.

0:00:12.200,0:00:15.710
And what’s the total sum of all of these
digits.

0:00:15.710,0:00:19.990
We’ve done that a few times but now let’s
try to do it using functions.

0:00:19.990,0:00:24.510
For example an execution could look something
like please enter a positive integer.

0:00:24.510,0:00:30.390
So user says three seventy five and then the
program would respond by saying three seventy

0:00:30.390,0:00:32.710
five has three digits right.

0:00:32.710,0:00:34.480
Three seven five three digits.

0:00:34.480,0:00:37.010
And their sum is fifteen three plus seven
plus five.
