0:00:00.539,0:00:07.149
I think we are ok now to implement or we can
start implementing the quadratic function.

0:00:07.149,0:00:13.980
So as we said the quadratic function gets
three inputs as parameters A B and C. It would

0:00:13.980,0:00:20.430
return the type of solution at our return
value and it would also update out x one and

0:00:20.430,0:00:29.300
out x two as the output parameters. For implementation
basically we want to use the formula we have

0:00:29.300,0:00:37.340
for the solutions of a quadratic equation
but that only works when A is a non zero value.

0:00:37.340,0:00:46.970
When we can divide by two A. So let’s first
make sure or calculate the cases where A is

0:00:46.970,0:00:56.300
non zero. And then in these cases we can use
the formula of x sub one two equals this thing

0:00:56.300,0:01:07.810
here. Let’s define the discriminant delta
to be b squared minus four A C and check whether

0:01:07.810,0:01:17.070
it is positive or equals to zero or else basically
means negative. In case it is positive we’ll

0:01:17.070,0:01:25.360
have x one be minus b plus the square root
of delta divided by two A. And x two would

0:01:25.360,0:01:34.229
be minus b minus the square root of delta
divided by two A. These are x one and x two

0:01:34.229,0:01:43.420
are basically our local instances of the solutions
then we want to return these two values. So

0:01:43.420,0:01:51.700
we will set out x one and out x two to these
two values and we should also return our type

0:01:51.700,0:01:57.759
of solution for that case which are two real
solutions. Right again make sure you first

0:01:57.759,0:02:03.520
return the values in the output parameters
and then do the return statement. Now let’s

0:02:03.520,0:02:11.200
take care of the case where our delta equals
zero. In this case we said we are assigning

0:02:11.200,0:02:18.019
out x one so let’s first have x one be minus
b over two A. Right the plus minus would be

0:02:18.019,0:02:22.680
plus minus zero that’s why we have only
one. So out x one that’s very important

0:02:22.680,0:02:29.840
by our assumption out x one would contain
x one and we return one real solution. And

0:02:29.840,0:02:38.340
in case A is not zero but our discriminant
is negative in this case we just say no real

0:02:38.340,0:02:44.569
solution. We don’t update out x one and
out x two at all and we said we are not defining

0:02:44.569,0:02:53.579
what would be returned by these values in
case there are no real solutions. Ok now the

0:02:53.579,0:03:01.319
last thing we have to take care of is what
happens if A is zero. In this case actually

0:03:01.319,0:03:09.170
our quadratic equation A x squared plus B
x plus C equals zero when A is zero basically

0:03:09.170,0:03:20.939
it becomes linear equation. B x plus C equals
zero we don’t have a quadratic element anymore.

0:03:20.939,0:03:29.760
So in this case we should solve it as a linear
equation. We can have the code here but actually

0:03:29.760,0:03:37.140
I think it would make sense if we would create
a function that deals with linear equations

0:03:37.140,0:03:43.919
separately. Then we can use this function
later on maybe not in this program but in

0:03:43.919,0:03:50.309
another programs as well. So it makes sense
to have or to define a function that not only

0:03:50.309,0:03:53.729
not only to define a function that solves
a quadratic equation but also to define a

0:03:53.729,0:04:00.260
function that solves a linear equation. So
the quadratic can use the linear but the linear

0:04:00.260,0:04:02.079
can be used in other scenarios as well.
