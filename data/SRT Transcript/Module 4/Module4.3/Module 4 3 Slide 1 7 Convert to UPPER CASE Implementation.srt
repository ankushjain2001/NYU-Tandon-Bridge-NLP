0:00:00.220,0:00:02.050
Ok so let’s implement this program.

0:00:02.050,0:00:09.360
First let’s ask the user for the lower case
letter so cout please enter a lower case letter.

0:00:09.360,0:00:11.150
Let’s break the line.

0:00:11.150,0:00:18.720
Let’s read it into a variable let’s first
declare it lower case letter and let’s read

0:00:18.720,0:00:23.500
it into this variable so cin into this variable
here.

0:00:23.500,0:00:27.599
And now we should convert lower case letter
to upper case letter.

0:00:27.599,0:00:31.489
So let’s have an upper case upper case letter.

0:00:31.489,0:00:36.910
Eventually the upper case letter variable
would store the equivalent of the lower case

0:00:36.910,0:00:37.920
letter value.

0:00:37.920,0:00:43.400
But we said that we first have to calculate
the offset of the lower case from lower case

0:00:43.400,0:00:51.250
A. So let’s have an integer variable named
offset that would store this offset and offset

0:00:51.250,0:01:00.490
would then be whatever the value of lower
case letter is from lower case A. So I have

0:01:00.490,0:01:06.760
lower case letter minutes lower case A. Now
this is a character and this is a character

0:01:06.760,0:01:11.420
and I want the integer value of this expression
here.

0:01:11.420,0:01:18.090
So subtract this two ASCII values the ASCII
of let’s say lower case T and ASCII of lower

0:01:18.090,0:01:21.670
case A and then you would have your offset
value.

0:01:21.670,0:01:29.800
So for example in lower case T the ASCII value
is 116 and the ASCII value of A is 97 so you

0:01:29.800,0:01:35.830
subtract 116 from 97 and that value would
be our offset.

0:01:35.830,0:01:42.440
Now we need to add this offset to upper case
A and that would be our upper case letter.

0:01:42.440,0:01:49.119
So upper case letter would then just be upper
case A plus this offset.

0:01:49.119,0:01:56.409
That would add whatever the offset was to
65 and would get us to 84 to upper case T.

0:01:56.409,0:02:02.420
Again we don’t really have to do all the
casting but let’s cast to char this expression

0:02:02.420,0:02:04.520
here which is of type int.

0:02:04.520,0:02:11.009
Once again when we add a char to an int it
would cast the char to an int first and it

0:02:11.009,0:02:12.430
would add it as two integers.

0:02:12.430,0:02:17.099
So let’s cast it back into char and that
would be our upper case letter.

0:02:17.099,0:02:23.980
Let’s now print the output message for some
reason I spelled it uppet case letter so let’s

0:02:23.980,0:02:27.120
change both of the declaration and where we
used it.

0:02:27.120,0:02:35.350
Now that it is consisted let’s cout upper
case of and now we need to have the value

0:02:35.350,0:02:38.819
of the lower case letter since it is a char
it would print it as a letter.

0:02:38.819,0:02:45.400
And then is and then the uppercase letter
and break the line.

0:02:45.400,0:02:49.580
I can endl or back slash n that would both
work.

0:02:49.580,0:02:54.060
Let’s try to execute it see if we don’t
have any silly mistakes here.

0:02:54.060,0:02:59.410
Once again please enter the lower case letter
we have lower case T and then it says that

0:02:59.410,0:03:02.980
the upper case of lower case T is upper case
T. Very well then
