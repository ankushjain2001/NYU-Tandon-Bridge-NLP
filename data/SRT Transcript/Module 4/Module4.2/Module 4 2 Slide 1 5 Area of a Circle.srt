Ok let’s use these types in order to implement
the following program.

0:00:06.339,0:00:12.880
Let’s write a program that reads from a
user the radius of a circle and then the program

0:00:12.880,0:00:16.309
would calculate and print the area of this
circle.

0:00:16.309,0:00:22.210
So for example we ask the user to enter radius
the user would say I don’t know 2.6 and

0:00:22.210,0:00:29.630
then the program would respond the area of
a circle with radius of 2.6 is in this case

0:00:29.630,0:00:31.130
21.2372.

0:00:31.130,0:00:35.490
Let’s take a minute and think how we would
implement it.

0:00:35.490,0:00:41.950
So kind of straight forward we can just use
the formula to calculate the area of a circle.

0:00:41.950,0:00:48.860
So if we have a circle with a radius of r
the area of the circle is just pi times r

0:00:48.860,0:00:49.860
squared.

0:00:49.860,0:00:52.820
Let’s use this formula in order to make
our calculation.

0:00:52.820,0:00:55.230
Let’s go ahead and implement it.
