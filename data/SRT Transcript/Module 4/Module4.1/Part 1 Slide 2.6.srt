00:00:00,819 --> 00:00:07,700
Ok so let’s try to use all the syntax we
talked about integers to implement a simple

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,349
problem.

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:11,610
We name it weeks and days problem.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,980
So let’s write a program that reads from
the user number of days they traveled.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,220
And then the program would print what’s
the travelling time in the format of how many

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:28,279
full weeks they traveled and how many additional
days are there.

7
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,180
For example if we executed this program the
program would ask the user please enter the

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,140
number of days you traveled.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:43,140
The user would say for example 19 and then
the program would respond 19 days or two weeks

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,270
and five days.

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,989
Because 19 days are two full weeks and extra
five days.
