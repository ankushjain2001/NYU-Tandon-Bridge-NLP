00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:07,109
Before we get into implementing it let’s
stop a second and think how we can figure

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:13,230
out how many full weeks and extra days are
there in a some amount of days.

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,470
So if we divide let’s say 19 by 7 we get
two with a remainder of 5.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,450
Two would be how many full times 7 fits into
19 which is the number of full weeks.

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,980
And 5 is basically the days remaining after
these two full weeks.

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:40,890
So once again 19 div 7 is the full weeks and
19 mod 5 would be the days remaining.

7
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,870
After we have that figured out it will be
quite easy implementing it using C++.

8
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,170
Let’s go ahead and do that.
