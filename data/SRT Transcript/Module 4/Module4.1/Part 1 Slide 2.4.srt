00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,260
Let’s stop for a minute and roll back to
I don’t know second grade.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:12,250
And recall what our math teacher used to say
when we divide 13 by 5.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,300
So when we divide 13 by 5 we get something
like 2 with a remainder of 3.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:27,050
Basically means 5 fits into 13 two full times
and there is still a remainder after these

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,910
two full times of 3.

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:38,510
There are two designated operators that give
us these 2 and 3 they are called div and mod.

7
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:44,499
For example if we do 13 div 5 we get 2.

8
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:50,889
Which basically div means how many full times
times 5 fits in 13.

9
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:54,960
So 13 div 5 results to 2.

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,370
And 13 mod 5 results to 3.

11
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,909
Basically meaning what’s the remainder when
we are dividing 13 by 5.

12
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:16,670
In C++ we don’t use div and mod in the textual
writing there are specific symbols to do div

13
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,670
and mod.

14
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:27,440
For div we have the slash operator so if we
have int slash int that would do a div operator

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,230
in this case that would be 2.

16
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:38,080
And for mod we will use the percent symbol
so 13 percent 5 would be 3 for the remainder

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,920
when we divide 13 by 5.
