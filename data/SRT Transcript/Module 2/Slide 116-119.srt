00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:06,350
Okay, let's see how we can convert a number
in one number system representation into the

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,730
equivalent number but in a different number
systems representation.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:16,160
Actually, I'm not going to show you the general
form of taking a number in base b1 and converting

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,449
it into an equivalent N in b2, I’m going
to show you two techniques to do some other

5
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:23,730
kind of a translation.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,029
So, first one would be taking a number “N”
and in an arbitrary base B. and converting

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:34,510
it into decimal that would be a very important
thing to be able to do.

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,930
Cause a lot of times you'll get numbers in
binary hexadecimal and you want to understand

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,240
what they mean, basically, so you convert
it into decimal.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,980
And the other way around is also something
important to be able to do.

11
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:53,829
Taking a number in decimal, your natural number
system, and converting it into, I don't know,

12
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:58,030
the computer's number system, the binary,
or the hexadecimal, or whatever.

13
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:05,990
If you think of it a bit deeper, you see that
these two translations actually allow you

14
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,830
to convert from any number system to any other
number system.

15
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:16,630
Just compose them pmrafter one of the others:
start with N and b1, convert it into a decimal,

16
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,380
and then take the decimal and convert it into
b2.

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:29,570
So, basically going from b1 to b2, stepping
in the decimal somewhere in the two-step process.

18
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,240
But I'll describe each of them separately.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,210
Let's start with how to take a number in an
arbitrary number system and convert it into

20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,170
decimal.
