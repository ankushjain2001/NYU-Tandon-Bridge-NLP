1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,899
Okay, now that we know how to count in different
number systems, we can see that we can represent

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:12,110
the same value in different ways, depending
on the number system we're working. Let's

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:18,320
take a look at the number 13. So, when I think
13, I have to be more specific because 13

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,119
can be a decimal number, can be an octal number,
can be a base five number. They all use the

5
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:30,530
digits one and three. So, I have to say what
kind of a 13 I'm referring to. Now that we

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:36,920
have a lot of number systems, the way to do
that is to subscript the number system we're

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,860
referring this number with the number thirteen.
We enclose it in parenthesis and say subscript

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,860
ten, basically meaning the decimal number
system.

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:51,340
Let's try to figure out what's the equivalent
value for the decimal thirteen in the octal

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:01:00,540
number system. So, let's try counting up to
thirteen. So one, two, three, four, five,

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:07,280
six, seven, octal would after seven would
group the ones into a ten, so we would have

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:16,720
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.
So a decimal thirteen is equivalent to a one

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,000
five, fifteen, octal. Let's try to figure
out what's the equivalent value in the base

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,020
five number system. One, two, three, four,
after four would come ten, eleven, twelve,

15
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,060
thirteen, fourteen, after fourteen, we have
another group so it would be twenty, twenty

16
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,870
one, twenty two, twenty three. So thirteen
decimal is equivalent to fifteen octal, and

17
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:50,640
to twenty three base five. Let's try to see
what this number is equivalent in the binary

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:02:04,560
number system. Again, letâ€™s count: one,
ten, eleven, one, hundred, one, 101, 110,

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:17,400
111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101. So
the decimal thirteen is equivalent to 1101

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:25,930
binary. Let's do the same for the hexadecimal:
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

21
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:32,770
nine, then would come A. B. C. D., so it would
be a D. hexadecimal.

22
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:44,220
So, a 13 decimal is equivalent to 15 octal
to 23 base five to 1101 binary and D. hexadecimal.

23
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:51,110
Once again, you see that a lower number system,
a binary number system, is a longer number

24
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:58,069
and groups more often. So, we get a longer
number. And a bigger number system, sixteen

25
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:03,459
for example, is a shorter number, it's one
digit in this case. It would be very interesting

26
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:10,220
to have a method to be able to convert a number
of presentations in one number system to its

27
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:19,590
equivalent in a number of another number system,
to translate N. in base b1 to N., the same

28
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,150
amount representing the same value, but in
base b2 and that's what we're going to do

29
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,170
next.
