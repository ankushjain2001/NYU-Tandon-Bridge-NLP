1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,900
What we do in fixed partitioning is when the
system boots up, we can divide main memory

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,540
into some static number of parts.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,059
Let's imagine a situation where we have four
megabytes, four gigabytes of main memory and

4
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:16,379
we're going to divide it up into let's say
sixteen different partitions, now those could

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,380
be either equal sized partitions or unequal
sized partitions.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,300
And if they are equal sized partitions, then
let's imagine that those sixteen different

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,480
partitions, each run two-hundred and fifty
megabytes in size, so our four gigabytes of

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,540
main memory is broken down into sixteen equal
partitions of two-hundred and fifty megabytes

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,960
each.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,530
Now that works; it’s fine.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,350
It means we have a maximum limit of running
sixteen different processes; we can't run

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:50,010
any more than sixteen different processes.
and one other problem is if we start up notepad,

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,680
and notepad is going to just edit a small
text file and it only needs one megabyte of

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,170
main memory, well the smallest we can put
it in is two hundred fifty megabytes, because

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,740
we have equal sized partitions.

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,600
So, what that means is that we're wasting
two-hundred and forty megabytes of main memory

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,030
and that's pretty significant.

18
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,100
That's what we call internal fragmentation.

19
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,830
We have this division allocated, for notepad,
we give it two-hundred and fifty megabytes

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,100
for notepad and notepad only really wants
one megabyte.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,960
And the other two hundred forty megabytes
now are wasted in internal fragmentation.

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,410
One solution that we could use is to maybe
use unequal sized partition, so partitions

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,960
which are differing in size.

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,020
And if we do that we might say there are sixteen
different partitions, one partition is very

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,110
very big it's one gigabyte, and other partitions
are very very small there might be ten meg,

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,729
ten megabyte partitions or just slightly larger.

27
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:56,810
The point is that we're always going to have
some internal fragmentation with these solutions,

28
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,180
but we're going to maybe minimize the amount
of internal fragmentation.

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,750
Now if we use unequal sized partitions, we’re
going to have to worry about which partition

30
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,840
we decide to place this process in.

31
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,739
Let’s say we open up notepad and we open
up a small text file and so the operating

32
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:20,469
system decides, okay we'll put it into one
of the ten megabyte partitions and then somebody

33
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,549
chooses to open up an enormous file of one
gigabyte file.

34
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:27,719
Let's say a video file but they're opening
in Notepad.

35
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,879
Well now the operating system has to move
that process out of its memory space; we can

36
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,329
do that because of relocation and move it
into the one gigabyte partition that we have,

37
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,870
the only one gigabyte partition that we have.

38
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,529
And what happens if that one gigabyte partition
is taken by something else, maybe chrome,

39
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:50,400
and now notepad cannot run at the same time
as Chrome, because they both need that one

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
gigabyte partition.

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,400
So, there are some real disadvantages to having
fixed partition.

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,309
But one of the big advantages of it is it's
really simple, really requires very little

43
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:02,749
effort on the part of the operating system.

44
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:07,280
But the downside is that we have very limiting
factors on the number of processes that we

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,090
can run, and we also waste a lot of memory
in internal fragmentation.
