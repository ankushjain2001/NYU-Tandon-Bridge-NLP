1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,580
We covered a lot of material in this module,
and memory management is not a simple task

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,890
at all, we know that.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,450
The operating system does a lot of work for
memory management.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,560
But we did cover the need for memory management
and we covered the memory management requirements;

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,449
we understand those requirements of protection,
and relocation, logical organization, sharing,

6
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:21,089
physical organization.

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,960
We talked about partitioning strategies.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,609
We talked about logical versus physical addresses,
and how to convert them, specifically in the

9
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,419
paging scenario we did a lot of calculations
on how it works.

10
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,240
We talked about virtual memory.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,880
We talked about the working set strategies
and the resident set strategies and we used

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,260
resident set strategies to determine how we
can control the load of the system, how many

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,240
processes we really have running.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,820
And then we talked about shared pages and
copy on write and then the magic of the Unix

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,820
FORK function.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,150
So, we certainly covered a lot on memory management
there, of course in a current and current

17
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,079
system today's environment, thereâ€™s a lot
more that has to go into memory management

18
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,600
and these are only the basics.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,600
But at least with the basics we can get started
with understanding some of the more complex

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,049
features, and the operating systems courses
are going to cover a lot of memory management

21
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,170
techniques that we just kind of glazed over.

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,149
So, there's a lot more out there; some of
it that Microsoft will even tell us about

23
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:19,969
we have to find out manually.

24
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:23,740
But there's at least a good basics in this
module.
