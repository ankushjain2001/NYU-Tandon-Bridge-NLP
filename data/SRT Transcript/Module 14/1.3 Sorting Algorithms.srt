00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,720
There are a lot of sorting techniques; one
is selection-sort, insertion-sort, bubble-sort,

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,500
merge-sort, quick-sort, heap-sort, and many,
many more.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:18,249
In this model we're going to focus on only
two of them: the selection sort and merge

4
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:19,249
sort.

5
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:23,080
Selection-sort is a very basic naive sorting
algorithm.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,830
Merge-sort is a more sophisticated one but
a very nice one as well.

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,409
Let's go ahead and start with a selection-sort.
