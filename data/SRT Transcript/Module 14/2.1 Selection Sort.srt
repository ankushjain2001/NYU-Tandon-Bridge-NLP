00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:03,919
Let's take a look at selection sort.

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:11,580
As I said earlier it's very basic our sorting
algorithm, maybe the most intuitive or naïve

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:20,730
algorithm we can think of; sort of how you
would explain your kid how to sort using this

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,830
approach.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,090
So, let me demonstrate the idea here.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,850
So, assuming we have a collection of elements,
obviously not sorted: five, fourteen, ten,

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,580
eight, thirteen and so on.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:41,409
It would be an iterative process each time
placing the minimum element at the next position;

9
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,999
so it's going to work something like that.

10
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:52,569
So let's take a look at the entire range we’re
sorting and first iteration, we are looking

11
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:58,399
to place at the zero position, in the first
position, the minimum element.

12
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,559
So we’ll search for the minimum element,
we’ll get this one, index-five, and then

13
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,880
we'll just swap them.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:16,950
So one would be at the beginning and five
would be somewhere at the rest of the elements.

15
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,799
So our range would now be only the elements
from the second on.

16
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,799
This iteration, second iteration, will place
the second minimum at the second position;

17
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:34,109
we’ll search for the minimum in that varied
range: that would be two and we'll swap the

18
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,979
two in fourteen placing two at that position.

19
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:43,290
The range is shorter now; we'll search for
the minimum that would be three and we'll

20
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,969
swap them, three and a ten, so three would
be in the right position.

21
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:52,270
So now we have one, two, and three already
ordered, and next we find the minimum in the

22
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,270
valid range.

23
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,640
That would be three in the index-eleven and
we'll swap them.

24
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,119
So, three would be at the right position and
so on and so on.

25
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,880
Yeah, let’s try to implement this idea.
