00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:06,950
Let's talk about two fundamental searching
algorithms. The first one is the most general

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,490
searching algorithm; it will implement a function
search that is given an array, basically the

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,609
starting address when of an array and its
logical size, and in addition it would also

4
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:25,949
get value, an integer value, val. And this
function should return an index inside this

5
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,840
array where val first appears. Or if val doesn't
appear as one of the elements in A R R this

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,950
function would just return a negative one.
So, for example, if array contains five, eight,

7
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:45,239
twelve, seven, eight, and ten; for example,
if we call the search function with this array

8
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,790
of size six searching for the value eight,
we're expecting to get the index of the first

9
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:56,289
time where eight appears. That's the second
position so the index would be one; this function

10
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:03,480
in this case should return one. If we call
the search function on the same array of size

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,590
six searching for four, which as you can see
doesn't show in the array, the function should

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,360
then return a negative one. So let's implement
the search function.
