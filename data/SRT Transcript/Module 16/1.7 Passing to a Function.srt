1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:05,111
When we're going to pass an ifstream or an
ofstream an object to a function, or return

2
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:07,319
it from a function as we'll see later on.

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,700
Those have to be passed or returned by reference.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,880
So the ampersand has to be there.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,910
The reason for that is that the act of writing
to or reading from a file, actually changes

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,070
the object.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:28,290
Specifically, we have inside the file object,
inside the representation, inside C++, we

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,200
have a pointer to how far into the file we've
been working with.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,370
So that when we read in, we're always reading
in from where we left off on the last read

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,600
in operation.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,320
Now obviously any read in or write out operation
is going to change that file pointer, and

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,910
that's an act of changing the object which
means it has to be passed in by reference

13
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,950
or returned by reference from a function.
