1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:05,830
So we can always use the ignore function if
we want to skip over a set of characters.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,230
Now what the ignore function does is it allows
us to tell it how many characters we want

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,989
to skip or what character we want to stop
at skipping.

4
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:20,849
so you'll commonly see something like in File
dot ignore, and then nine nine nine nine and

5
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:25,789
then backslash n in a character in a single
character scene and single quotes there.

6
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:29,769
which means we're going to skip over nine
thousand nine hundred ninety nine characters

7
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:32,780
or the first return character that we see.

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,399
so it basically skips to the end of the line
as long as the line is not more than one thousand

9
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,800
nine hundred ninety nine characters.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,100
and what this is useful for is if we want
to read in part of the line, not the whole

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,230
line, and then we want to skip to the end
of the line.

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,940
we can use the read in operation like the
input operator and then we can once we've

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,730
got the information that we want we just ignore
the rest of the line and then go back to using

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,149
the input operator to read in the next lines
piece of information that we want.

15
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,530
So the ignore function is actually a very
useful function.

16
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,870
Sometimes we might be at the end of the line,
because we just did an input operator and

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,630
we stop the trailing whitespace, the return
characters trailing whitespace, and the next

18
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,510
line we want to read in the whole line.

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,380
if all we did was a get line we would get
nothing because we were really looking at

20
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:27,800
the return character, but we can first do
it an ignore and skip over that return character

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,460
and then read in using the Get line then the
whole next line.

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,510
So get line and ignore kind of go together
and ignore is the solution to having to do

23
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,410
get line after we've done an input operation
using the input operator.

24
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,480
we put in ignore in the middle to make sure
that we skip over that return character and

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,380
the next line we're going to get the whole
line As opposed to a blank which is nothing

26
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:51,880
at the end of the line.
