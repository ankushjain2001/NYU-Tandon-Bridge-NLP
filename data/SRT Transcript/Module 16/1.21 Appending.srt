1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,279
One thing that we may want to do, which is
actually very common to do inside programming

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,520
and inside the file system, is adding data
to the end of a file.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,980
So you might have seen a log file, you might
have a log file which keeps records of transactions

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,960
or you might just want to record a large amount
of information and you don't want to have

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,249
to read in the data and then add to the end
of it and write it, out as we've said we would

6
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:27,249
have to do.

7
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:33,969
So there is an option inside C++ called appending
and what appending does is leave the contents

8
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:35,850
of the file alone.

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,120
So in the original file, nothing will have
changed and what we do is add on to the end

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,410
of the file.

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,670
To do this we have a second parameter that's
passed to the open function so when we open

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,640
it, we're going to specify the file name first
and then we're going to specify this IOS double

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,239
colon APP.

14
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,340
And that's the way to tell C++ any ofstream
object that we don't know that we want to

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,670
append to the file and not overwrite it.

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,470
If the file doesn't exist, it’s going to
be created and then we’ll add on to the

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,720
end of this brand new blank file, so it's
effectively like writing.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,470
If the file doesn't exist, then IOS APP really
has no impact on what happens internally in

19
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,060
the ofstream object.

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,659
However if the file does exist, it sort of
does seekG, if you will, to the very end of

21
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,310
the file and then any information that you
write into the file is going to be added on

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,729
the end of the file, rather than overwriting
what's existing there.

23
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,960
So, if what we're doing is taking in data
from the user and storing it on the file system;

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,520
we might take in some data in one run of the
program, write it out to a new file and then

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,939
the second run of the program, we don't want
to overwrite what the user already gave us,

26
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:52,210
so we'll just append on to the end of the
file.
