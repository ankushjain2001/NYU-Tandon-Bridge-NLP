1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,170
The first thing we have to understand is that
there's so much data that has to be entered

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,030
into most programs that it's really unreasonable
to ask the user to type it in at the keyboard

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,179
each time the program starts.

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,209
And of course we understand this from our
past experiences with Word and Excel and PowerPoint

5
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:19,400
and all the other regular programs that we
use generally store that information in a

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,400
file.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,220
And a file is a nice compact way of keeping
track of all the data that's needed for a

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,850
particular run of a program.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:33,050
There needs to be a way to access data on
the file system and in fact, we need to talk

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,240
about both the input and the output.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,770
Input means bringing data from the file system
into our programs and using it for processing

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,990
or whatever we want to do with it.

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,260
Output means taking the data from our program
from main memory or from wherever we have

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,290
it stored in variables or vectors or arrays
or wherever, and putting it out on the file

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,290
system.

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,720
And this is actually a two part process; there's
actually two steps here.

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,750
So that when we're working on a file we would
have read that file initially, we would work

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,780
on it in main memory, and then we would output
that file back to the file system.
