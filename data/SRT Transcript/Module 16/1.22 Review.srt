00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,839
In this module we saw how to open files for
both reading in and writing out.

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,700
We saw how to write out information to a file;
how to read in information from a file.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,200
We talked about some of the pitfalls of opening
files as well as reading in and writing out.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,480
We saw how the input operator works, specifically
the three-step process of skipping leading

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,450
whitespace and then reading invalid characters
and then stopping when it reaches trailing

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,450
whitespace.

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,640
We saw the use of the getLine function, the
ignore function, we saw a seekG, and we saw

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,370
how we can append onto the end of the file.

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:40,329
So at this point you should have the abilities
to write into your code file processing routines

10
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,929
so that you can bring in information directly
from a file.

11
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:50,089
And we can now you use very large datasets,
which allow us to do quite a bit of information

12
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:53,980
processing, and we don't have to worry about
a user sitting there for hours typing in on

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,579
the keyboard.
