1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,890
So C++ makes output relatively easy and it's
not really very difficult.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,210
All we have to do is create one of these ofstream
objects; that's the first step.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,940
So we create the ofstream object and of course
we give it a variable name like out file is

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,830
descriptive enough to tell us what that file
is going to be, and then we have to open it.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,790
And when we open it we tell it the full filename
that we want to open as you see here we've

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,910
got filename dot TXT.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,280
Or you could also if you wanted to skip the
step of opening it, you could also just use

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,390
the constructor for the ofstream class and
pass the filename to the constructor.

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,380
Only in very rare instances will opening an
output file fail; but it still could.

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,470
For example, you might not have permissions
on the drive to create a file, or the drive

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,610
might simply be out of space.

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,830
If any of those things happen, we're going
to see how to detect that opening a file has

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,760
failed in just a few minutes.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,930
But you should check for that every.

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,850
If it's important that the file is going to
open, you should check to make sure that the

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,390
file does open.

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,229
Now once the files open, you can write to
the output file exactly as you would write

18
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:10,280
to the screen.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,670
So it's a simple output operation you can
say outfile arrow arrow, or output operator.

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,860
And then print out your string or print out
your variable or any capability that you would

21
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,959
have to write it to the screen output to see
out, you have the ability to write it to this

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,159
output file.

23
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,149
And it works again very much like printing
to the screen.
