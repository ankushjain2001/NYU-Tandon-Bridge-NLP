1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:05,210
The harder obstruction layer is a magic little
layer that Microsoft built in, and to understand

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,000
why Microsoft even needed the HAL in the first
place you have to look back again in history.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,860
Sorry, but we're going to dial the clock back
again.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,769
And go back to the mid, maybe the early 1990’s.

5
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:24,429
In the early 1990’s, Microsoft was not the
big player in the market that they are today.

6
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:31,550
If you look today, most computers and I say
most I mean almost all computers run Windows,

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,180
run Microsoft, some version of Microsoft Windows.

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:43,940
The latest indications that I have here in
2016 are that Microsoft Windows runs on between

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,000
91 and 92 percent of the hardware that's out
there.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,239
So as far as computers are concerned, Apple's
market share is around seven to eight percent,

11
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,699
at least those among the numbers that I have
today; seventy to eight percent, whereas Microsoft

12
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:01,000
is ninety-one to ninety-two percent.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,260
And there's that one-percent/two-percent other
which includes Linux and some Unix's.

14
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,500
In any case, back in the day, back in the
1990’s, early 1990's, that wasn't the case

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,900
at all.

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,510
The operating systems were broken down much
more towards about thirty percent was windows,

17
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:25,890
about thirty percent was Mac, and by Mac I
mean a completely different hardware architecture,

18
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,430
and then there was also thirty percent other
things like Unix's in these sorts of hardware.

19
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,110
And Microsoft wanted an operating system which
they could market literally to everybody,

20
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,290
and so what they did was they designed the
architecture in a modular fashion so that

21
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,490
the lowest level, the level that actually
communicates with the hardware.

22
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:53,390
Not manages things like running processes
and scheduling and dividing up memory and

23
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:59,250
allocating it, not that thing but the code
that actually communicates directly with the

24
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,020
DMA controller, the interrupt controller,
the hard drive, things like this that are

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,920
very, very, very low level.

26
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,050
Microsoft designed them into a component they
called the hardware abstraction layer.

27
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,060
And the hardware abstraction layer was a set
of functions that the kernel could call on

28
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,340
to perform tasks on different, on the various
hardware.

29
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,160
So, rather than directly programming the timer
in the system to say: let this process run

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,210
for twenty milliseconds.

31
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,550
The hardware abstraction, the operating system
would call a function inside the hardware

32
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,760
abstraction layer to say program the timer
to let this process run for twenty milliseconds.

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,480
And the reason that that's essential is because
Microsoft can change out the HAL and produce

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,770
an operating system that can now run on a
completely different hardware.

35
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,350
Without making any other changes to the operating
system, it can change just the functions inside

36
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,350
the HAL and those functions will, those features
will take effect on the new hardware.

37
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,010
And Microsoft did this in the early 90’s
and produced five different operating systems,

38
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,310
now they were all Windows NT 4 0 but they
were five different versions of Windows NT

39
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,310
4 0.

40
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,770
One for the Intel architecture, one for the
Power PC architecture, and there were various

41
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,140
other architectures that Microsoft could support.

42
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,200
Now over the course of the next five/ten years,
all of the other architectures disappeared.

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,720
Even Apple; now if you go and buy an Apple
Macintosh, you're going to buy a MacBook let's

44
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,420
call it, let's say a MacBook.

45
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,510
You're going to buy something that runs on
the Intel architecture, and that means that

46
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,270
it could run Windows just as well as it could
run MacOS.

47
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:42,550
And that's to our benefit of course because
we want to do that we want to do exactly that.

48
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:49,020
But Windows has the support for the HAL which
has support for multiple hardware, and when

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,990
Microsoft, for example, released Windows RT.

50
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,540
When it came out, Microsoft said we can now
support ARM architecture and the way that

51
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,750
they did that was in part changing the HAL.

52
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,470
So, any changes that we make to hardware,
really only require changing the HAL and that

53
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,379
saves us from having to rewrite the whole
operating system; it's a very effective tool.
