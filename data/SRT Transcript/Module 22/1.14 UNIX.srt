1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,310
Unix was designed to be a multi-user, multi-tasking
operating system.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,830
And what that means is that we are designing
an OS which is going to run on a centralized

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,390
machine and have lots of users; not one person
sitting at a keyboard a screen but in fact

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,419
lots of users accessing this all the same
time.

5
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:25,169
And in the era of the mainframe computer,
when you didn't ever access the mainframe

6
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:31,419
computer; I remember people telling me stories
of writing their programs on punch cards and

7
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:37,390
leaving punch cards in companies for the mainframe
operators to load into the mainframe.

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,280
They never directly interacted with the mainframe
the whole idea of Unix was actually very nice

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,030
because you could directly use the mainframe
or directly use the computer.

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,690
Unix was designed to allow users to manage
their own tasks and this was one of the first

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:59,079
time sharing systems that came about and that's
why it was so popular because it decentralized

12
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,510
responsibility.

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,109
Your users only got a very small portion of
the time allowed to run on the system and

14
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:10,470
nobody could take too much time on the system
or too much resources, I should say.

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,850
But it was allowed to access directly the
mainframe, and do your work directly on the

16
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,159
mainframe and have immediate feedback rather
than delayed feedback whenever the mainframe

17
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,200
operators cited for your program to run.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,979
The other thing about Unix that was great
was that it was released into the public domain

19
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,299
with open source.

20
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,319
When you got UNIX you didn't just get the
operating system; you also got the source

21
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,609
code.

22
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:39,240
And it was released in the public domain with
public licensing, public domain licensing,

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,869
so that if you made any modifications to the
Unix operating system You could re-release

24
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:48,929
it as your own, except that you couldn't charge
for it.

25
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:53,929
So, you couldn't take the Unix operating system
and make one change and sell it for hundreds

26
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:55,960
of dollars; It wasn't allowed.

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,630
In fact, all they allow for is what's called
a media charge So a few dollars for the cost

28
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,670
of the media on which you would distribute
the source code, and you had to release the

29
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,890
source code as well for whatever changes.

30
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,720
Now Unix comes in a lot of different flavors
comes in AIX, Linux, Solaris, etcetera like

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
that.

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,600
And some of them are branches of the original
UNIX, so they're now public domain which means

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,190
if they made any if they used any of the original
source code of Unix, or any subsequent source

34
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,810
code of Unix, they have to be public domain.

35
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,420
There are some companies like IBM who designed
AIX from scratch to look like Unix, but include

36
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,590
none of the source code of Unix so that they
could license it and sell it and make money

37
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,590
off of it.

38
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,460
So, there are some versions like that.

39
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,920
And that's how Apple gets away with selling,
or what they used to, sell MacOS was because

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,220
they used BSD, which was a completely new
implementation of Unix; it didn't use any

41
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,920
of the original Unix.

42
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,360
So, Unix has been modified many, many, many,
many times over the years, but what we have

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,780
is this basic idea of a multi-user multi-tasking
operating system.
