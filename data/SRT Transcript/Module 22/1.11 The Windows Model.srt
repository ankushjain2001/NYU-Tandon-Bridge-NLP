1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:04,351
I want to show you now, and I hope you don't
get too concerned by this image that you're

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:10,469
going to see, of what the inside of Microsoft
Windows looks like or at least what Microsoft

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,809
will tell us the Windows model looks like.

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:18,340
And I really want you to concentrate on a
few items that are below the line, below the

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,220
solid line.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,769
What we're seeing here is the components of
the kernel, and in fact you can see that indication

7
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,080
that shows you kernel mode versus user mode;
user mode being above and kernel mode being

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,150
below.

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:37,070
Now the lowest level of here that we want
to consider is the HAL, the hardware abstraction

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,070
layer.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,690
We're going to talk about that in just a minute.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,650
But I also want you to see that there are
some other components for device drivers as

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,060
well as video drivers, a few things that have
to be built in.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:55,330
There's a virtual memory manager; those components
that are the fundamental components of the

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,520
operating system are down there in kernel
mode.

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,550
Now if you remember back from the computer
architecture discussion.

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,770
There is kernel mode as well as user mode,
and we're going to talk about this a lot more

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,969
in later modules.

19
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:12,240
But kernel mode has complete access to the
entire system, whereas user mode has a much

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,799
more limited access.

21
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,469
So, what I want you to get away and take away
from this is that Windows is of course a very

22
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:22,939
complex model, it's been around it's been
being developed now for over thirty years,

23
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:25,429
so it's a very complex model.

24
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:30,340
But what I want you to see is that at the
very bottom there's only a few layers that

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,899
directly communicate even inside the operating
system with system hardware, and there's good

26
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:36,899
reason for that.

27
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:41,850
Inside the kernel mode, we just keep track
of processes and other things, most of the

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,670
work of the Windows kernel is actually done
outside of kernel mode.

29
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,240
And the reason for that is one of security
as well as organization and it's much easier

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,549
to update things that are outside of the kernel,
than things that are inside of the kernel.

31
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,670
So, take a look at this image just don't,
donâ€™t memorize it don't, don't study it

32
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,790
too hard.

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,979
Just take away some of the major components
of it that you can at least keep track of.

34
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,500
And understand that modular operating system
design is really what we absolutely have to

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,610
do today, because there are so many things
that the operating system has to do just even

36
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,860
to run the first program.
