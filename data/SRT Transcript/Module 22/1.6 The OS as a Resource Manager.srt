1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,769
If we look at the system, as a whole the computer
system, what we can see is that it's a collection

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:07,029
of resources.

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:11,639
And the resources that we have are memory
and CPU time and file handles and network

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,600
connections and it goes on and on and on and
on; those can all be seen as a resource. and

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,900
the operating system, since it is the primary
controller of the entire system the first

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,230
software that will run, the operating system
controls all of those resources.

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,960
And it needs to allocate those resources to
some programs that you as a user decide to

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,230
run.

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,240
Now the operating system itself is software.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,330
So, it's going to need to use some of those
resources; it's going to need some memory

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:48,690
for itself, it's certainly going to need to
run code so that CPU time, it may need files

12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,280
to open up more connections or may need files
to open up more information, whatever has

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
to happen.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,360
The operating system is a client of itself
in a lot of cases.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,689
But the applications are really what the users
care about, when you as a user start up your

16
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:10,170
machine the forty five seconds or two minutes
or however long it takes to boot up your computer

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,409
and get to the screen where you can finally
do something: the desktop.

18
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:20,149
You consider that time wasted; you consider
that time that you can't do anything with

19
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:21,859
your computer.

20
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:28,149
And we try to minimize that time as operating
systems designers; we try to minimize that

21
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:33,619
time, so that you don't have to go to waste
that time, you can use that time for other

22
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:34,619
purposes.

23
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,579
For example, sleep mode on either a MAC or
a PC, when you close the lid the computer

24
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:45,329
goes to sleep rather than shut down altogether
so that when you open the lid again on a laptop,

25
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,119
it comes back to life and most immediately.

26
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,289
The way that we can do that is actually quite
simply the computer still running; it just

27
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:56,009
shuts down all the non-essential services
like the screen, and the wireless card and

28
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,149
things like that and it has uses a very, very,
very small amount of power to keep running

29
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:04,329
to continue keeping the memory active.

30
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:11,560
But the point is the resources that we have
are going to be allocated to different applications

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,900
as well as to the operating system.

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,959
And these resources are limited, so we have
to keep track of them and we have to make

33
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,770
sure that we're not wasting any of those resources.

34
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,810
There's going to be a lot of situations in
operating systems we concern ourselves with

35
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,879
this in the operating systems design classes
here at NYU, but one of the things we take

36
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,680
into account is that we might have an algorithm
which solves our problem perfectly but we

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,280
can't use it because it takes way too much
time to run that algorithm.

38
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,920
And if we did that it would actually slow
the system down as a whole.

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,840
So, even though the algorithm works perfectly
and doesn't exactly what we need to do, we

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,340
can't use it because it just takes too much
time to run.

41
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,769
So, the operating system has to dole out these
resources to various applications as well

42
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:05,180
as to itself, in a studious manner so that
it takes care of not wasting the resources

43
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,070
as well as allocating them effectively so
that the programs can do what they need to

44
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,079
do.
