1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,600
Windows device drivers, or device drivers
in general, are kernel layer software that's

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,090
written by the companies that designed the
hardware.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,571
Now let’s take for example a video camera
that's built into your laptop computer, so

4
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:17,580
you might be looking up at the top of the
screen right now you see a little video camera.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,280
That video camera was designed by a hardware
company and we don't know who designed it;

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:30,050
it may be some Apple company or some company
that Apple contracted with or perhaps it's

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,649
Logitech, which is one of the most popular
web cam companies perhaps Microsoft contracted

8
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:37,640
with, who knows.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,360
Some hardware developer designed a web cam
and the manufacturer of your computer incorporated

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,820
that hardware design into their laptop so
that they could use the web cam.

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,649
Now when the hardware designers designed their
web cam, it works differently from one designer

12
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:58,929
to the next.

13
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:06,570
So, Logitech’s commands for taking a picture
are not the same as Microsoft's commands for

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,150
taking a picture, or Apple's commands for
taking a picture.

15
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,440
Whoever the hardware designer is, they designed
the chip so that it takes a picture after

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,730
it's given a certain command.

17
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,380
Now Microsoft doesn't want to have to know
all of the commands for all of the hardware

18
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,660
manufacturers that could possibly create a
web cam, so what they do is they provide a

19
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,910
facility for incorporating a piece of software
that the hardware designers will develop;

20
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,910
software that the hardware designers will
develop into the operating system and allow

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,700
it access to the camera so that it can program
the camera to take a picture.

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,880
Now what happens is Microsoft says if you
are a web cam designer you create these functions:

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,760
Take a picture, take video, turn on light,
whatever it is.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:03,020
And if Microsoft calls the take picture function
then the code from that device driver does

25
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,300
whatever task is necessary in order to take
a picture and return it back to the operating

26
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,310
system in whatever way that Microsoft is expecting
it.

27
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,640
So, they define this protocol for communications
between the operating system and the device

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,909
driver. and then the device driver can do
whatever it needs to do in order to actually

29
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:26,439
take the picture and return it to the operating
system.

30
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,599
Now that works great, except for the fact
that these device drivers have complete unfettered

31
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,359
access to the entire operating system and
what they discovered was that while hardware

32
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:40,189
designers might be very good at designing
hardware, They're really not good at writing

33
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:41,189
software.

34
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:48,980
So, in the late one 1990’s and even in the
early 2000’s, Microsoft had a real problem

35
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,790
with device drivers causing device driver’s
code, which remember it’s code, crashing

36
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,760
and causing the entire system to become unstable
and eventually crashing the whole system in

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,090
what we call a “Blue Screen of Death.”

38
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,670
So what Microsoft did was design or specify
a lab… they created this lab that says:

39
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,480
if you're a hardware designer and you want
us to certify your drivers, send us your software,

40
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,080
send us the source code as well as a piece
of hardware, we’ll test it out, make sure

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,370
it's one hundred percent compatible with Microsoft
Windows and it doesn't cause a crash inside

42
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,370
the operating system.

43
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,519
It can't crash the operating system and as
long as everything's working properly and

44
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,599
we'll certify your driver and give it back
to you with the our stamp of approval.

45
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,370
And they call this the Windows Hardware Quality
Labs or WHQL.

46
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:43,329
And nowadays it's nearly impossible to install
in Windows ten or any of the later versions

47
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,790
of Windows, to install any drivers that are
not WHQL certified.

48
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,379
You have to go through an enormous process
to install those drivers, just for testing

49
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:54,489
purposes.

50
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,510
You basically certify that Microsoft, that
you know that Microsoft has no knowledge of

51
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,400
these drivers, and that it may destabilize
your system and cause mass floods and virus,

52
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,030
and I'm kidding about that.

53
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,139
But you know that you're doing something that's
outside of the ordinary.

54
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:16,570
So, the whole idea of the WHQL was that this
device driver code had so much access to the

55
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,129
system that if it was not written perfectly,
it would crash the whole operating system

56
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,270
and we don't want that.

57
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,880
So, we have avoided the whole “Blue Screen
of Death” now by having certified drivers

58
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,100
that are certified with WHQL.

59
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,550
And I think you can we can all agree anybody
who lived through that era of blue screens

60
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,150
of death, every day, if not multiple times
a day, we found the this is actually a very

61
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,330
good idea.
