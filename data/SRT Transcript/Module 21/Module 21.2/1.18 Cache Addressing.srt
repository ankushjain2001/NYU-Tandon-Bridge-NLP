1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,100
Now let us now see the role of the block offset
and the cache tag fields in the physical address.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,750
Remember that each D RAM or cache block is
at least 16 bytes.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,789
In MIPS64, an instruction is four bytes and
an instruction in.

4
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,130
So each block can have four instructions.

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,430
The role of the cache block offset field is
to indicate which of the four instructions

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,830
in the block to access for a given address.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,570
In case of a data access, each data can be
at most 8 bytes in MIPS64.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,390
So a cache block of 16 bytes can up to two
double words.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:44,920
So the goal of the offset is to indicate which
of the two double words the address is requesting

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,309
Let us see the role of the cache tag.

11
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:54,559
Assume we have a 16 megabyte D RAM and a 16
kilobyte cache with a 2-way set associative.

12
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,450
Now consider the following addresses: 001C
and 004018.

13
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:06,359
When we break the addresses into the different
fields, we see that they both have same cache

14
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,990
set 0.

15
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,030
This means, when accessing these addresses,
the cache controller will go to same cache

16
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,139
set 1 to find.

17
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:19,779
However, they have different D RAM blocks,
which makes sense because they are different

18
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:20,779
addresses.

19
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:25,380
So, the role of the cache tag is to determine
which D RAM block that the content of a cache

20
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,689
block belongs to.

21
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:32,029
So, if we concatenate the cache tag and the
cache set, we get the D RAM block.

22
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:37,889
So, when searching for a data in the cache,
the cache controller has to also compare the

23
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:42,249
cache tags to see if it is getting the correct
instruction or data.

24
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:43,899
We will see an illustration of this later.
