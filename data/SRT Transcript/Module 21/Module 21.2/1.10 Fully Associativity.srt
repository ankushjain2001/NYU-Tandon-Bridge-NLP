00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:05,900
The next cache associativity we will discuss
is full associativity.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,930
In a fully-associative cache, a D RAM block
can go into any cache block that is unoccupied.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:16,510
In the figure, the blue D RAM block can go
to any cache block that currently doesnâ€™t

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,739
have data or instruction.

5
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:22,539
So the fully-associative cache is the opposite
of direct map.

6
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,769
It tries to keep the content in the cache
for as long as possible by allowing it to

7
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,140
be put anywhere that is free.

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,810
Therefore, fully-associative cache has very
good temporal locality.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,340
However, since the data or instruction can
be anywhere in the cache, we may have to look

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,680
to the whole cache to find it.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,480
If we look at the cache as an array of blocks,
it may take several cycles to get the data

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,510
or instructions, leading to more access delay.
