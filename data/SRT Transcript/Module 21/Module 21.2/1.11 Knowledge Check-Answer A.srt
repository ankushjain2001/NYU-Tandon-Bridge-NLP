00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,930
Remember, in a direct-mapped cache, a DRAM
block can only go to one location in the cache.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,330
So there is no need to search for the whole
cache, one can simply go to that one location.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,190
Thus it takes one clock cycle to search the
cache
