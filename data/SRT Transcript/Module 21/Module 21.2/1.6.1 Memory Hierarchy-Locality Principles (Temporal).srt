00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:07,529
For that the cache uses two locality principles
known as temporal and spatial locality principles

2
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:08,529
of temporal and spatial locality.

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:13,840
Temporal locality basically states that if
a data or instructions is used once, it is

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,299
likely to be used again soon.

5
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:21,430
Therefore, once an instruction or data is
brought into the cache, temporal locality

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,210
suggests to keep it the cache as long as possible.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,600
One of the best examples of temporal locality
is loop code.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,160
When we go in a loop once, we are very likely
to go through it again.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,510
Therefore, it is best to keep the loop code
in the cache, rather than overwrite it or

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,019
move it back in the main memory.
