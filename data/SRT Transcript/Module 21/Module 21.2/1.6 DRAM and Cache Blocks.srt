00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:06,359
So now let us look at how caches are organized
and how data and instructions are moved from

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:07,759
the main memory to the cache.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,330
Let us first go over some basics.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,049
First, the main memory is organized into blocks,
each block being of the same size.

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:22,119
The CPU designer can configure the memory
blocks to be 16, 32, or 64 bytes.

6
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:27,150
Each cache in the CPU is also organized into
blocks that are the same sizes as the main

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,199
memory blocks.

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,610
But since the size of a cache is much smaller
than that of the main memory, there are significantly

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,690
less cache blocks than there are main memory
blocks.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:45,020
For example, if we have a memory hierarchy
with 16-byte blocks, a 2 gigabyte main memory

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,690
will have over 1 million blocks, whereas a
32 kilobyte cache has a little bit more than

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,440
2 thousand blocks.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,230
So the key question is how does the CPU move
data and instructions between the caches and

14
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:57,890
the main memory?
