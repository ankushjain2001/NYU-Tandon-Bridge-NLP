1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:07,380
For the arithmetic and logic R-format instructions,
the ALU of the CPU simply performs the operation

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,150
using the values of the registers Rs and Rt.

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:18,300
Recall that during the decode step, the CPU
already has Rs and Rt in A and B respectively.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,679
The only thing that is an issue is how can
the ALU determine what operation to perform

5
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,970
for that R-format instruction.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,929
Recall the second opcode or function field
of the R-format instruction.

7
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:36,149
The ALU has a lookup table that contains the
arithmetic or logic operation to perform based

8
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,199
on the value of the function field.

9
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:44,539
So, the CPU simply sends the value of A and
B registers and the value of the function

10
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,629
field of the R-format instruction to the ALU.

11
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:54,229
The latter used its table to perform the operation
and stores the result in ALU Out 2.
