1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,669
To maximize the throughput of the pipelined
CPU, it must always have a new instruction

2
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:07,019
in the fetch stage.

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,809
The only way that occurs is if the instructions
in the other stages are moving along.

4
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,970
This way, there is an instruction at each
stage of the pipeline at all times.
