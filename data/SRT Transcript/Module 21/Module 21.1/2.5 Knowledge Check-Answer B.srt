1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:01,589
That is correct.

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,400
The fetch step only increments the counter
by 4, under the assumption that the next instruction

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,550
to be executed is the sequential one.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,019
The CPU doesn't yet know if the instruction
is a branch.

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,579
That is what the decode step is for.
