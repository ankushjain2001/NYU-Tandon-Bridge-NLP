00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,530
The main issues with a pipelined CPU are conflicts
that it encounters when executing multiple

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,830
instructions simultaneously.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:14,701
These conflicts are commonly known as hazards
and are categorized in three groups: structural

4
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:19,499
hazards, data hazards, and branch hazards.

5
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:24,410
Structural hazards occur when multiple instructions
need to access the same CPU resource at the

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,019
same time.

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:31,949
Data hazards occur when an instruction needs
to read a data that is being modified by another

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:32,949
instruction.

9
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:38,620
And branch hazards occur when a branch instruction
is being executed and the CPU needs to know

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,500
if the branch is taken or not before it fetches
the next instruction.
