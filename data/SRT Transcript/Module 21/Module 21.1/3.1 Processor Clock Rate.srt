Let us now discuss the performance of this
CPU.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,359
First, let's go over the concept of CPU clock
rate.

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,929
Usually, when we buy a computer, one of the
factors that we look at is the CPU frequency.

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,800
The frequency essentially is representative
of the clock rate, which defines how fast

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,220
each operation can be performed.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,400
The metric of the clock rate is the clock
cycle.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,790
To determine out how many seconds a clock
cycle last, we simply take the inverse of

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,110
the CPU frequency.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:36,230
For example, if we have a 1 gigahertz CPU,
one clock cycle takes 1 divided by 1 gigahertz

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,160
which equals 1 Nano second.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,610
What this means is that each operation of
the CPU takes 1 nano second to perform.

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,710
In this respect, an operation can be thought
of as the work of one state in our CPU high-level
