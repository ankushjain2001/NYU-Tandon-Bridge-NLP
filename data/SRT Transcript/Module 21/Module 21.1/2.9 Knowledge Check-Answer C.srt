1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,740
That is correct. A is a temporary

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,080
register that holds the value of RS,

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,240
which in our case is FFFC. 0 is a 1 bit

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,040
flag that holds the result of the

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,889
operation of the ALU. Since the operation

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,280
for this instruction is RS minus 0, the

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,370
result is not 0. Therefore, the zero flag

8
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,690
is remaining 0.
