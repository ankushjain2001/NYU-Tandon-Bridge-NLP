1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,010
That is correct.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,390
The load double instruction needs to accesss
the memory to get the data and write the data

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,410
to the destination register.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,520
The first part is done in the memory step,
and the second one is done in the WriteBack

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:12,950
step.
