00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,430
Let us discuss each execution step in detail.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,330
In the instruction fetch step, the processor
uses the program counter to access the memory

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,660
and get the instruction to execute.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,651
The syntax M and PC in brackets indicates
a memory access where PC is the address is

5
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:22,480
used for the access.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,550
When the memory returns the instruction, the
CPU puts it in a special register known as

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,480
the instruction register, or IR.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,129
This register always holds the 32 bits of
the instruction being executed.

9
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:40,370
The last part of the instruction fetch is
to update the program counter to point to

10
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,999
the next instruction.

11
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:45,789
This is done by adding four to the current
program counter.

12
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:50,629
The value four is used to increment the program
counter because each instruction is 32 bits

13
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:51,850
or four bytes.

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:57,909
Therefore, the CPU has to jump four bytes
of address space to go point to the next instruction.
