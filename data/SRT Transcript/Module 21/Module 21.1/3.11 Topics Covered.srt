1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,460
We covered the various instruction formats
of MIPS64 architecture and detailed how they

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,139
are used to encode information about the operations
of different instructions.

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,630
We also discussed the five main stages of
CPU execution and their intricacies.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,380
Then, we covered processor pipelining, which
is one of the most fundamental aspects of

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,410
computer organization.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,300
We discussed the benefits of pipelining in
term of throughput, the hazards they present,

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,170
and the common mechanisms used to overcome
these hazards.
