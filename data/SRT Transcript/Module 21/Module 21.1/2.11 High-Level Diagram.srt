00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,900
Ok.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,660
Now, let us design a high-level state diagram
of our small CPU.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:12,169
The high-level diagram will break down the
steps to execute each instruction into states

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,240
and will show when to transition from one
state to the other.
