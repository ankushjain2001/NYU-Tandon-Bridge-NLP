1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,850
A J-format instruction only has one operand:
a 26-bit immediate value.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,400
J-format instructions are used for jump instructions.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,309
Therefore, the 26-bit immediate value is used
as an address parameter to use to calculate

4
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,200
the target address of the jump instruction.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,330
Just like I-format, each J-format instruction
has its own opcode and does not need a 2nd

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,330
opcode.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,190
Just like all instructions, the CPU first
read the opcode to determine the format.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,370
In the case of this example, the opcode matches
to the Jump instruction.

9
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:39,969
Since the jump instruction is a J-format,
the CPU just reads the next 26 bits to determine

10
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:41,570
the value of the address field.
