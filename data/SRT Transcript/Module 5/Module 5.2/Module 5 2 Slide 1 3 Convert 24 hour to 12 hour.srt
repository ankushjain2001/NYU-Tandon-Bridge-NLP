0:00:00.599,0:00:05.210
Let's try to write a program now that reads
from the user a time, entered in a twenty

0:00:05.210,0:00:10.550
four hour format and then the program would
print the equivalent time in a twelve hour

0:00:10.550,0:00:11.550
format.

0:00:11.550,0:00:16.650
So for example the user would be prompted
to enter a time in twenty four hour form,

0:00:16.650,0:00:19.680
that it would they would say I don't know
fifteen

0:00:19.680,0:00:25.950
colon thirty seven, and for that input the
program would respond by saying that fifteen

0:00:25.950,0:00:29.690
thirty seven is three thirty seven PM.

0:00:29.690,0:00:37.069
So, basically we're converting time in a twenty-four
hour format to twelve-hour format adding the

0:00:37.069,0:00:39.489
AM PM and stuff like that.

0:00:39.489,0:00:48.329
I'm sure you're familiar with these two formats,
but let's take a second look here how these

0:00:48.329,0:00:49.329
formats basically work.

0:00:49.329,0:00:56.780
So in a twenty four hour format, we have all
the hours going from running from zero to

0:00:56.780,0:00:58.399
twenty three.

0:00:58.399,0:01:04.780
The first twelve are considered to be A.M.,
so zero to eleven are considered to be AM.

0:01:04.780,0:01:12.920
Where twelve to twenty three are obviously
considered to be PM, so that's the period

0:01:12.920,0:01:15.610
value.

0:01:15.610,0:01:22.400
Regarding the twelve hour format an hour or
so in the first half of the day the time basically

0:01:22.400,0:01:29.440
remains, so one in the twenty four hour format
is one AM, two is two am, three is three am,

0:01:29.440,0:01:32.729
and so on up to eleven which is eleven am.

0:01:32.729,0:01:40.149
Where in the second half of the day then the
time doesn't really stay the same, we kind

0:01:40.149,0:01:49.479
of shift it twelve hours back so thirteen
is considered to be one pm, fourteen is considered

0:01:49.479,0:01:55.010
to be fourteen minus twelve which is two pm,
fifteen is three pm and so on up to twenty

0:01:55.010,0:01:57.210
three which is eleven pm.

0:01:57.210,0:02:02.229
So it seems that the first half of the day
the hour basically stays the same and the

0:02:02.229,0:02:09.590
second half of the day the hour is shifted
back twelve hours, twelve numbers before.

0:02:09.590,0:02:20.900
That's almost true, there are two exceptions
here, in the first half of the day, zero is

0:02:20.900,0:02:22.350
not zero A.M.

0:02:22.350,0:02:28.200
So, zero doesn't stay the same just as one
stayed one A.M. and two stayed two AM.

0:02:28.200,0:02:30.300
Zero is twelve A.M.

0:02:30.300,0:02:41.120
So it has different behavior here, same thing
regarding twelve or noon, twelve doesn't become

0:02:41.120,0:02:46.040
zero P.M. is not shifted back twelve hours.

0:02:46.040,0:02:52.510
Twelve kind of remains twelve P.M., so most
of the hours in the first half of the day

0:02:52.510,0:02:55.210
remain the same besides zero.

0:02:55.210,0:03:00.900
Most of the hours in the second half of the
day are shifted back twelve hours, besides

0:03:00.900,0:03:01.900
twelve P.M.

0:03:01.900,0:03:07.340
So, this is basically how the twenty four
hour and twelve hour format works.

0:03:07.340,0:03:09.840
Let's go ahead and implement this program
now.
