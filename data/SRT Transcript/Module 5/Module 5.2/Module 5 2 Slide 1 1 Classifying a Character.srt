0:00:00.580,0:00:07.340
Let's use all of these statements in order
to implement the following problem; let's

0:00:07.340,0:00:12.480
write a program that reads from the user a
character and classifies it to one of the

0:00:12.480,0:00:18.340
following: either lower case letter, or an
uppercase letter, a digit, or a character

0:00:18.340,0:00:23.950
that is not alphanumeric So, in the execution
of the program could behave something like

0:00:23.950,0:00:28.550
that first the user's prompted to enter a
character, the user then says, I don't know

0:00:28.550,0:00:34.740
says upper-case D. and then the program would
respond by saying uppercase D is an uppercase

0:00:34.740,0:00:36.610
letter.

0:00:36.610,0:00:37.950
Let's try to implement.
