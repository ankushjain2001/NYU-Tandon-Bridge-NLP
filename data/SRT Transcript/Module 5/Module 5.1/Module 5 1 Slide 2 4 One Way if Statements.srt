0:00:00.710,0:00:06.870
So, we have the syntax of a one way IF statement,
I want to show you an extension of the syntax.

0:00:06.870,0:00:13.370
So originally or formally, we can condition
the execution of a single expression.

0:00:13.370,0:00:16.360
You can see that the body here contains a
single expression.

0:00:16.360,0:00:22.560
In case we want to condition the execution
of several extensions, we use this syntax

0:00:22.560,0:00:29.980
here: where we have a compound expression
that is basically a set of instructions that

0:00:29.980,0:00:32.460
are enclosed in curly braces.

0:00:32.460,0:00:40.440
So, the syntax would go IF parenthesis and
the condition in it, and then open the curly

0:00:40.440,0:00:48.879
brace, we have a set of instructions, again
pushed one tab to the right and close curly

0:00:48.879,0:00:51.510
brace and then the program just continues.

0:00:51.510,0:00:58.640
So, we kind of group together a set of instructions
into a single compound expression using these

0:00:58.640,0:01:06.680
curly braces syntax and this way we can condition
the execution of a set of instructions.

0:01:06.680,0:01:10.280
A lot of times we use this kind of syntax.
