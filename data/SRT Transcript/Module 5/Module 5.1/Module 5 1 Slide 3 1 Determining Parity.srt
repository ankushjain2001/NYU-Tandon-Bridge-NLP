Let's try to write another program now.

0:00:02.889,0:00:07.430
Let's try to write a program that reads from
the user a positive integer and determines

0:00:07.430,0:00:10.160
its parity: whether it's even or odd.

0:00:10.160,0:00:15.429
So, for example the program can prompt for
the user to enter a positive integer, the

0:00:15.429,0:00:22.480
user would I know say seven, and then the
program would respond by saying seven is odd.

0:00:22.480,0:00:26.619
Let's see how we can, how we can implement
this program.

0:00:26.619,0:00:33.220
So, now that we have if statements it seems
much more reasonable we can use the one way

0:00:33.220,0:00:36.110
if statement in order to implement this program.

0:00:36.110,0:00:43.399
But it would be better to use a two-way if
statement in this case.

0:00:43.399,0:00:49.290
I’ll talk about the if else statement which
is a two-way if.

0:00:49.290,0:00:55.219
We’ll implement this program and afterwards
with a compare the if else implementation

0:00:55.219,0:00:59.600
verses of a one-way if implementation of the
same program.

0:00:59.600,0:01:04.820
But let me first introduce you to the two-way
if statement, the if else statement.
