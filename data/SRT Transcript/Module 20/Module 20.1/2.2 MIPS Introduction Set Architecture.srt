1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,230
So in this class, we will use the MIPS processor
architecture as reference.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,010
MIPS stands for Microprocessor Without Interlocked
Pipeline Stages.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,769
MIPS uses RISC architecture, is open-source
and is commonly found in gaming systems such

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,730
as Playstation 1, 2, Playstation portable,
and the like.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,730
In this class, we will use MIPS64 architecture.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,830
Each MIPS64 instruction is 32 bits long.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,810
The default word size is 32 bits.

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,300
However, the 64 and MIPS64 indicates that
the processor can do operations on data as

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,979
large as 64 bits, or double word.
