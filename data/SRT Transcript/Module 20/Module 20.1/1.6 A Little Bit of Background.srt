00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,139
CISC architecture does the reverse of RISC.

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:07,850
That is, it has very complex machine level
instructions, where an instruction can perform

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,210
multiple high-level operations.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:15,980
For example, an instruction can do both a
memory access operation and an addition operation.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,019
The main benefit of this is that it makes
it easier to translate high-level code, such

6
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:24,480
as C or C++ into machine instructions, simplifying
the compiler.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,100
The downside is that the hardware of the CPU
is more complex because of the multiple operations

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,859
that an instruction can perform.

9
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,180
The most popular CISC architecture is x86
from Intel.
