00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:07,759
The double word add instruction adds two registers
Rs and Rt and puts their result into Rd register.

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,570
The ALU may need to perform some sign extension
to ensure that the content of both Rs and

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,460
Rt are 64 bits

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,340
The store doubleword instruction has a similar
syntax as load double word but the semantics

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,010
are obviously different.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,090
Store doubleword copies the content of register
Rt to the memory location indicated by the

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,110
address calculated.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,850
Similar to load doubleword, the calculation
of the address requires the offset field to

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,850
be sign extended to 64 bits.
