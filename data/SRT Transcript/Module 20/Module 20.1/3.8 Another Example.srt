00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,729
As an exercise, I am encouraging you guys
to try the following exercise. First, write

2
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:12,290
the MIPS Mnemonic code that performs the high-level
code above. This code does A = B or C. Note

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,860
that this is a logic or operation. Once you
have written the mnemonic code, show its execution

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:24,770
in the table as we did before for A = B+C
example. The code and data segment addresses

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,210
are specified, as well as the original values
of A, B, and C.
