00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,080
I have added a document on the course site
that summarize the 32 MIPS general purpose

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,999
register that we have discussed earlier.

3
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:10,670
You guys don’t have to memorize their purposes,
this is just as a reference.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:17,369
I also added the official documentation of
the MIPS64 instruction set architecture.

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,539
If you guys have any questions regarding anything
we discussed, don’t hesitate to send me

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,539
an e-mail.

00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:23,189
Thanks.
