1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,790
So we have gone over a high-level view of
the most important components of a generic

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:10,519
CPU, discussed general purpose registers and
the functionality and we have differentiated

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,519
the RISC and CISC computer architecture.

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,230
In this class, we will use a RISC architecture
known as MIPS to cover the different topics.
