00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,120
So, letâ€™s quickly go over two types of CPU
architectures in the market.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,610
One is called Reduced Instruction Set Computing
or RISC, and the other is called Complex Instruction

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,289
Set Computing, or CISC.

4
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:16,010
The decision of which of those architectures
to use impacts how the machine-level instructions

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,960
of the CPU work, how the hardware and data
path of the CPU are implemented, and how the

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,960
compiler for that CPU works
