Hi.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,050
My name is Jerry and I will be your instructor
for the Computer Architecture and Organization

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,460
Section of the CS-Bridge Program.

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,560
So far, we have covered several paradigms
and techniques of computer programming.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,580
And these techniques have enabled us to write
software code for different purposes.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,310
So in this section, we will cover how the
CPU interprets this code and executes it.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,009
Then we will discuss what is inside the CPU
that allows it to execute such code.

8
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:29,729
More specifically, weâ€™ll cover the assembly
language and mnemonic machine code, which

9
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:35,180
are human-readable representations of machine-level
instructions, we will go over the CPU execution

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,040
steps, and we will detail the microarchitecture
of the CPU.
