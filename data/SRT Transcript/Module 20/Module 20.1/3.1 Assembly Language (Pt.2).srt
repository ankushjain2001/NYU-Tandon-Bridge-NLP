1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,310
Weâ€™ll now pick up from the MIPS mnemonic
notation and start discussing some aspects

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,050
of CPU execution.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:12,589
We will use a table to show how the CPU updates
registers and memory when executing each instruction.

4
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:16,960
We will then discuss the three instructions
we have covered so far and detail their fields

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,420
and how they work.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,050
Finally, we will review the 32 MIPS general
purpose registers and what their roles are.
