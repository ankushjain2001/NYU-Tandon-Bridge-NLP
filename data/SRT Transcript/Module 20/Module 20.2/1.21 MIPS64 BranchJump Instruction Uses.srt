00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,259
Now let's take a look at an example of how
jump and branch instructions are used for

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:06,259
loops.

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,280
Consider the following example.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,720
We have two integer variables X and Y, both
greater than zero.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,240
The goal is to perform X times Y, without
using the multiplication instruction.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,660
One way to implement this function in a high-level
C or C++ code is as follows.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,710
We have a while loop that uses a decrementing
counter initialized at Y.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:33,310
Inside the loop, we add X to an accumulator
as long as the counter is not zero.

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,020
Note that for this approach, it doesn't matter
if C and Y are always greater than 0.

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,190
Another approach is to leverage the fact that
X and yYare both greater than zero.

11
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,610
In that case, we know that the loop will be
executed at least once.

12
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,190
So we can use a do while loop for the code.

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,120
We will use that second approach to implement
the MIPS mnemonic code.
