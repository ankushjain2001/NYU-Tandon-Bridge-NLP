1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,170
The branch condition can be determined from
the information available.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,390
We know that R8 is 3 and R0 is always zero.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,110
The branch checks if R8 is not equal to R0.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,340
In our case, the branch condition is true.
