1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,730
When we say a branch is taken, what we mean
is that the comparison of the branch condition

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,990
is true.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,759
We donâ€™t necessarily mean that the registers
are equal.

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,759
So if the branch checks that two registers
are not equal, such as branch if not equal

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,420
does, and the registers are indeed not equal,
then the comparison of the branch condition

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,289
is true and the branch is taken
