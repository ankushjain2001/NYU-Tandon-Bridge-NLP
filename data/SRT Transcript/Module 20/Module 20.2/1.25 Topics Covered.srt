1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,420
We have covered branch and jump instructions,
which are fundamental in all instruction set

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,870
architectures.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,889
As we have seen, these instructions allow
the CPU to manipulate loops, function calls,

4
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:14,900
and if and else conditions.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,350
This concludes the architecture portion of
the course.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,230
Next, we will start discussing computer organization
to understand how the CPU is designed to execute

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,189
its instructions.
