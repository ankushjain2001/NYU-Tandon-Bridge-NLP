1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,190
That is correct.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,240
We first check if the branch condition is
true; the registers are not equal, so the

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,050
branch condition is true and the branch is
taken.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,950
To calculate the target address, we take the
immediate value, sign extend it which gives

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,020
us all Fâ€™s because it is a negative one
in decimal.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,920
Multiply it by four which should give us FFFFC.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,880
And we add it to the value of the program
counter which should give us PC+4, which should

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,980
give us back the original value of the branch
if equal program counter.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,300
Hence, the branch instruction jumps back to
itself resulting in an infinite loop.
