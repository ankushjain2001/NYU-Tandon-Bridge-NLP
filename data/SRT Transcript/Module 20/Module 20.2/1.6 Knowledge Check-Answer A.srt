1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,850
Remember, by default, the CPU goes to PC+4
for non-branch and non-jump instructions.

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,620
Therefore, there is no need to use a jump
instruction to do PC+4.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,890
Jumps and branch are thus NEVER used to go
to the next instruction in the code sequence.
