1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,690
Here, you have to keep the size of the operands
consistent.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:11,309
Remember, this is a DADDI instruction, so
the ALU is going to use double word, or 64-bit

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:12,490
values.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,580
Therefore, you must sign-extended both the
register R8 and the immediate value to 64

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,090
bits before you do the addition.
