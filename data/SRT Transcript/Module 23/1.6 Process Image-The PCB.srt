1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,470
So, the operating system is going to need
to record quite a bit of information about

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,090
the process and in total the process is going
to be stored in what we know as a process

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,090
image.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,490
The operating system will keep a table known
as the process table with pointers to the

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,349
various process images for those processes
that are running inside the system.

6
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:24,779
And one of the components that are in the
process image is what's known as the PCB,

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,839
or in some cases you might consider the PCB
to be the actual process image.

8
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:35,700
It includes all the information that the operating
system needs in order to run and manage the

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,700
process.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:42,040
So, the PCB is a really critical component
of the operating system; it's usually implemented

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,350
as a simple struct with quite a bit of information.

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,870
So, what's in there?

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,700
Well we've got memory tables; we've got what's
allocated to the process.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,080
We've got what secondary storage is allocated
to the process.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,080
We've got IO tables, which are what devices
the process has access to and where it is

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,110
inside those devices.

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,120
We've got file tables with all the file handles,
so anytime we opened a file in our previous

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,670
programs that we create an entry in the file
table and that was stored inside the PCB in

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,090
the process image.

20
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,780
And then we've got stack pointers, and all
of these components make up the process image,

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,470
which includes all the code data and of course
this is the context.
