00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,130
When the desires of the CPU create the instructions
what they're doing is creating what's called

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,809
a set of instructions or an instruction set
and these are the set of instructions that

3
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,580
the CPU can perform.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,180
And it's usually a very small set just about
one hundred instructions or so each one represented

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,170
by a numeric value and when the CPU receives
a particular instruction it performs that

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,750
task that's associated with the instruction.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,540
Now one instruction might actually have multiple
codes associated with it if there are different

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:41,470
variables that are associated with that instruction
but fundamentally we only have a very small

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,460
set of instructions and they do limited operations.

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,280
And we have to work with the higher level
languages to bring the higher level languages

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,480
code down into the machine language code so
that it can actually run on the CPU.
