1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:07,169
So all the communications inside of the machine
the communications between the individual

2
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:10,600
components are done via a bus.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,710
And a bus is, actually the way that I usually
think about it is a big yellow school bus

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:21,340
moving from one component to the next and
carrying, not children in this case, but information

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,170
and the information can move either from one
component to the other or vice versa.

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:34,460
So it's a bidirectional communications pathway
in which we can send information and the bus

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,350
is actually something that exists physically
in the system.

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,829
So if we put the system under a microscope,
we could see the little copper lines that

9
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,140
go on the mainboard or on the component to
act as the physical bus.

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,399
So this is something that we can see physically
on the system if we probably put it under

11
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:02,079
a microscope because it's rather small, but
the system bus is the main pathway between

12
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,030
the CPU and main memory.

13
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,750
Now IO devices often have access to the system
bus as well for communications both to main

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:21,030
memory and to the CPU but the system bus is
primarily used priority for CPU and main memory

15
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,170
communications back and forth, and that's
what has to be done very very quickly inside

16
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,650
the system.
