00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:08,029
To give an easy definition of what a computer
is a very basic definition the computer is

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:13,390
an electromechanical device which takes input,
does processing and produces output.

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,590
And we know that what we define as a computer
today is a heck of a lot more, but this is

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,970
just a basic definition for what we think
should be in a computer in the most basic

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,529
form: taking input, do some processing, and
producing output.

6
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:32,640
It meets the very basis of the definition
and it doesn't have a lot of superfluous items

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,389
that we are not necessarily concerned with.
