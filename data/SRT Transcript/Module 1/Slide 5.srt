00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:07,880
So in this image, we've got what looks like
the inside of a desktop computer and you're

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,150
seeing hopefully what you would expect to
see when you open up a regular desktop computer.

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,680
In the upper right there we've got the power
supply, which has the big label that says

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,270
Dell on it.

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,520
And below that is what we call the main board
or motherboard of the computer where we have

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,340
most of the main components related to the
computer.

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,550
Down below it you'll see the CPU.

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,340
The memory is off to the left.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,000
A little bit further than that you have the
secondary storage device which in this case

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,980
looks like a spinning hard drive.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,530
All the way up in the upper left we have the
tertiary storage device which looks like a

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,720
CD-ROM and then run about the middle we have
the video controller card.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:54,090
So these are the major macro components of
what's inside of a computer and each of them

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,060
communicate with each other through the main
board which has components known as the system

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,940
bus, which we're going to talk about in a
little bit.
