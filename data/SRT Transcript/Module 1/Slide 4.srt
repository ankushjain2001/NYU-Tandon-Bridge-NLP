1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,009
We have a lot of different types of computers
in use in the environments today as well as

2
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:07,600
and past history.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,360
So we have this concept of a mainframe which
is a very, very large computer which used

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,029
to act for lack of a better term, used to
act as a central point for all the computing

5
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:22,429
done on a campus.

6
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:28,089
So for example, one university might have
just one mainframe for each campus in the

7
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:31,560
entire university and that's where all the
processing was done.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,760
Imagine only having one computer for the entire
university.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,170
It gets very very busy and the time on that
computer is very much in demand.

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,079
And then we move to a more common definition
today which is that of a server, and a server

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,230
would be something that probably exists in
a data center or in a room dedicated with

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,090
air conditioning and power controls.

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,170
This would not be used by most people, so
it would have a lot of capability a lot of

14
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,390
RAM a lot of CPU (we will talk about these
definitions later) but the server serves one

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,850
purpose.

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,000
And a desktop would be used by an end user
at one physical location (obviously) because

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,229
you don't want to carry a desktop around too
much.

18
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:16,640
A laptop we know we just carry it around and
use it just as a regular computer.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,240
A tablet is pretty much the same as a regular
laptop except without a keyboard, and that's

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,810
basically what we've come to these days.

21
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,909
And then we could also add that a portable
phone is by definition a computer because

22
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,909
it does take input, do some processing on
that input (your voice), and then encoding

23
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,290
your voice, and then it produces output in
the form of a signal it gets transmitted to

24
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,950
your cell provider.

25
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,380
So all of these are types of computers and
we're going to explore the commonalities between

26
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,341
these computers in just a minute.
