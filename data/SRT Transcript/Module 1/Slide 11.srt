1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:07,289
Probably the most important consideration
here is what the CPU does when it has to execute

2
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:08,640
instructions.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,120
And it performs what’s called the fetch-execute
cycle, or the fetch-decode-execute cycle.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,920
What it does is move one instruction from
main memory, which we haven’t talked about

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,430
but we will in just a minute, it moves it
from main memory into a register in the CPU,

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,210
which is known as the instruction register.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,820
And then it decodes the instruction and if
necessary moves in any necessary parameters,

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,600
so it copies those parameters in from main
memory.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,030
And once everything is complied in the CPU,
once everything is loaded in the CPU, then

10
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,510
the CPU can actually execute that instruction
and do whatever the task is that is asked.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,329
For example, if we had an add instruction
which added two numbers together, the fetch

12
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,090
would be for a particular memory location.

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,150
And we would bring that memory location to
the register, and we’d add that to a value,

14
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,939
maybe that’s already in the CPU or maybe
its in main memory.

15
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:10,970
Once the operation is complete, then we repeat
the process with the next instruction in the

16
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,970
sequence.

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,689
So this operation happens very very very quickly
in the system and it has to happen literally

18
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:21,960
millions of times per second in the CPU.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,530
Which means each operation could take as little
as a bout 10 nanoseconds to perform this operation

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,240
which is unbelievably small.

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,229
Nano is one times ten to the negative nine,
so we’re talking about something happening

22
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,930
incredibly quickly inside the system.

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:44,180
So while it happens very frequently, literally
millions of times a second, it happens very

24
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,680
very quickly.
