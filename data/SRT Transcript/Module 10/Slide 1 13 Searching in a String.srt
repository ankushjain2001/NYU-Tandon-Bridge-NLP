Ok so we know a lot of things about the string
class.

0:00:05.290,0:00:09.759
One more thing I want to talk about now is
searching in a string.

0:00:09.759,0:00:16.230
So assuming you have a string and you want
to search if you have some substring contained

0:00:16.230,0:00:17.230
in it.

0:00:17.230,0:00:21.529
The syntax to do that is by using the find
method.

0:00:21.529,0:00:26.800
You call the find method on an original str
string so you do str dot find.

0:00:26.800,0:00:32.540
And then you pass as a parameter the string
you are searching for in this case s.

0:00:32.540,0:00:41.930
Let me show you how it works for example if
we have str the original string ABCDEFG whatever

0:00:41.930,0:00:46.320
you can call str dot find of DE.

0:00:46.320,0:00:52.129
Basically searching for DE inside the original
string the original str.

0:00:52.129,0:00:59.010
In this case you can see that DE is a substring
of the original string the find method would

0:00:59.010,0:01:02.609
just return the starting index of DE.

0:01:02.609,0:01:13.030
So A is zero B is one C and so on DE starts
I think in index six so if we print whatever

0:01:13.030,0:01:16.930
str dot find returns in this case it would
just print six.

0:01:16.930,0:01:24.420
Let’s take a look at another call for the
find method for example if we’ll call str

0:01:24.420,0:01:27.520
dot find on a string XYZ.

0:01:27.520,0:01:35.670
In this case XYZ is not a substring of the
real original str so find needs to tell us

0:01:35.670,0:01:44.680
needs to return some value that says that
XYZ is not found in str.

0:01:44.680,0:01:52.840
Find returns in this case a constant named
npos that is stored in the string namespace.

0:01:52.840,0:01:59.610
In order to access the string namespace basically
we use the syntax string double colons and

0:01:59.610,0:02:03.579
then npos that’s the constant name.

0:02:03.579,0:02:13.290
So we can do something like if str dot find
XYZ equals to the npos constant we can just

0:02:13.290,0:02:18.540
print not found otherwise if it doesn’t
equal to npos basically it returns a valid

0:02:18.540,0:02:20.640
index it is found.

0:02:20.640,0:02:26.460
In this case when we are searching for XYZ
obviously it would return that it didn’t

0:02:26.460,0:02:31.690
find the XYZ in the original str and therefore
it would print not found.

0:02:31.690,0:02:35.520
Let’s take another look here.

0:02:35.520,0:02:41.550
What do you think it would happen if we’ll
call the find method to search for CD in the

0:02:41.550,0:02:43.250
original str?

0:02:43.250,0:02:50.270
I believe you noticed that CD appears more
than once in this original string.

0:02:50.270,0:02:58.170
It appears ABCD and then B and another CD
so we have two occurrences of CD.

0:02:58.170,0:03:04.510
Any guesses on what find would return when
we call it to search for CD?

0:03:04.510,0:03:12.310
So maybe it would return arbitrarily one of
the positions maybe it would return a collection

0:03:12.310,0:03:13.660
of the entire indices.

0:03:13.660,0:03:20.060
I’ll just tell you that find the find method
just returns where the first occurrence of

0:03:20.060,0:03:24.460
the string we are searching for appears in
the original string.

0:03:24.460,0:03:31.250
In this case CD first appears at index two
therefore it would print two.
