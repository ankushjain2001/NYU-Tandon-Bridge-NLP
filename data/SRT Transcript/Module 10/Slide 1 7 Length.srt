One last thing I want to say in this context
here is to tell you about a new or another

0:00:08.300,0:00:11.100
method that is defined in the string class.

0:00:11.100,0:00:14.090
And that’s the length method.

0:00:14.090,0:00:18.850
The syntax is str dot length and then empty
parenthesis.

0:00:18.850,0:00:25.169
Once again it is a method so in order to calculate
the length of a string you need to give the

0:00:25.169,0:00:26.770
string as the calling object.

0:00:26.770,0:00:33.289
So it would be I don’t know str one or str
two or whatever the variable name is dot length

0:00:33.289,0:00:38.079
and then empty parenthesis and that would
result as the length of the string.

0:00:38.079,0:00:41.510
The number of characters in that string.

0:00:41.510,0:00:47.600
So that is also useful if we want to figure
out how many characters are in a string.

0:00:47.600,0:00:51.030
If we want to iterate over the string or for
any other reason.
