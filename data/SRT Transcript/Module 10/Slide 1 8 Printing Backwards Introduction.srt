0:00:00.760,0:00:04.020
Ok let's use this syntax in order to implement
the problem.

0:00:04.020,0:00:11.520
So this program would read the user's name
and print this name in a reverse order.

0:00:11.520,0:00:17.020
So for example we would prompt the user please
enter your name the user would say Donald

0:00:17.020,0:00:22.840
Duck and then it would print whatever so Donald
Duck in a reverse order.

0:00:22.840,0:00:24.869
So let's go ahead and implement it.
