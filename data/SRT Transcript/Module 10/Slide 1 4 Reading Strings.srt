0:00:00.750,0:00:05.970
For now we know how to initialize and concatenate
strings using the assignment operator and

0:00:05.970,0:00:06.970
the plus operator.

0:00:06.970,0:00:11.590
Let’s see how we can read a string from
the user.

0:00:11.590,0:00:16.880
So for example let’s take a look at these
few lines of code.

0:00:16.880,0:00:22.869
If we print please enter your name ask the
user prompt the user to enter their name we

0:00:22.869,0:00:27.130
can then cin into a string variable.

0:00:27.130,0:00:31.980
And afterwards we can cout this value this
name this str.

0:00:31.980,0:00:37.120
So when we executed we ask the user please
enter your name the user says for example

0:00:37.120,0:00:38.790
I don’t know Donald Duck.

0:00:38.790,0:00:47.460
And then kind of surprisingly when we print
str we get only Donald back.

0:00:47.460,0:00:54.370
If we take a look what happened here basically
when we used cin in order to read the string

0:00:54.370,0:01:01.610
it only read the first word out of the line
that the user basically entered.

0:01:01.610,0:01:04.440
And that’s how cin works.

0:01:04.440,0:01:07.930
That’s the way cin was designed.

0:01:07.930,0:01:18.229
It is skipping leading white spaces then reads
the word and stops at the next white space.

0:01:18.229,0:01:23.040
In this case cin read Donald into str.

0:01:23.040,0:01:28.659
If we want to read an entire line and that’s
a thing we would like to do a lot of times

0:01:28.659,0:01:35.180
we would need to use some other way of reading
a string and that would be by using the get

0:01:35.180,0:01:38.870
line the get line function.

0:01:38.870,0:01:44.950
It works something like that we just call
get line and get line has two parameters that’s

0:01:44.950,0:01:45.950
kind of surprisingly.

0:01:45.950,0:01:53.820
The first parameter is cin itself and then
the string we want to update the line with.

0:01:53.820,0:02:02.110
So get line cin str basically reads an entire
line basically a sequence of characters until

0:02:02.110,0:02:07.549
the new line is pressed into the str variable.

0:02:07.549,0:02:15.190
You’ll see in later modules that get line
can be given a different first parameter besides

0:02:15.190,0:02:22.470
cin and for now what I want you to know is
that this cin basically tells get line to

0:02:22.470,0:02:25.580
read this line from the standard input.

0:02:25.580,0:02:28.810
From the basically the keyboard from whatever
the user enters.

0:02:28.810,0:02:34.590
Later on you will see that there could be
other inputs where or other streams that can

0:02:34.590,0:02:40.489
give us input besides cin or besides the standard
input.

0:02:40.489,0:02:47.709
So if we execute this code here we would prompt
the user to enter their name and then when

0:02:47.709,0:02:55.950
the user enters Donald Duck get line cin str
would read the entire Donauld Duck into str.

0:02:55.950,0:03:00.739
Then when we print str we would get Donald
Duck printed.
