0:00:00.390,0:00:03.410
So this is the syntax for the find method.

0:00:03.410,0:00:08.640
We have our calling object str dot find and
then an additional string we are searching

0:00:08.640,0:00:12.530
for passed a parameter to the method.

0:00:12.530,0:00:20.279
I want to say or tell you about an extension
of the find method that in addition to the

0:00:20.279,0:00:24.119
string we are searching for we also pass a
starting index.

0:00:24.119,0:00:25.630
Let me show you how it works.

0:00:25.630,0:00:28.640
So let’s go back to the example we’ve
talked before.

0:00:28.640,0:00:34.840
If we’ll search for CD and give a starting
index of three.

0:00:34.840,0:00:43.079
In this case the first occurrence of CD after
index three would be actually the second occurrence

0:00:43.079,0:00:47.780
of CD in the original string which is I think
index five.

0:00:47.780,0:00:49.969
Yeah that’s what it basically prints.

0:00:49.969,0:00:57.820
So the extended version searches for s but
starts not at the beginning but at whatever

0:00:57.820,0:00:59.640
starting index we give it.

0:00:59.640,0:01:04.100
And gives us the first occurrence of the s
after that position.
