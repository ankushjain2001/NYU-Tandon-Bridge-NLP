1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,509
Now that we've created an object, for example
the date object, we have to take a look into

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,740
the object itself a little bit more.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:15,440
And C++ has a really interesting structure
that it creates inside every object and it's

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,640
called this: this is actually a pointer which
points to the object itself.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,920
It's sort of like a pointer back into itself.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,390
And this pointer points to what we call the
calling object, so when you make a function

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:36,170
call like a dot set year, the this pointer
will be pointing to a inside the set your

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,230
function.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,360
So it's really useful in a lot of cases, for
example, if you created a person class and

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,220
you wanted to have a recognition that the
person could be married for example.

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,579
Then each person would have a spouse pointer,
a pointer to another person so speak, and

12
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,190
when you get married, of course one person
marries the other person but then that second

13
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,660
person also marries the first person at the
exact same time.

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:09,530
So we would have a function call like a dot
marrying B, in which case A's spouse pointer

15
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,960
should point to B, and B's spouse pointer
should point back to A. And the only way that

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,060
we can get a pointer to a is with this, so
the this pointer is needed in a lot of situations

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,660
where we need to recognize that we have some
pointer back to the object that we're working

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,720
in right now.
