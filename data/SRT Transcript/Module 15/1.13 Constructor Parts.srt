00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,650
Here I'd like to demonstrate that we can actually
do this two different ways.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:10,790
In the previous slide, you saw the method
that we used was creating a value for the

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,650
day, month, and year, and what I'd like to
show you here is that we can use what's called

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,590
the member initialization list.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,489
So the constructor, if we put a colon at the
end of it and then we have a list of the data

6
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:26,640
members, and we don't have to have all of
them we can have some inside the member initialization

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,980
list and some initial-ised inside the code.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:37,060
This allows us to construct the member variables
using whatever values we'd like.

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,710
But I'd also like you to take a look at the
other method, which is creating the data inside

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,060
the code for the class, without the use of
a member initialization list.

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,500
At this point it's really up to you which
you like to do.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,440
I just want you to see both.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,520
Later on there will be a situation where we
can only use the member initialization list,

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,579
but for now it's entirely up to you which
you'd like to use.
