1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,430
So now that we can talk about object oriented
programming, let's get into what we can do

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,370
in this module.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,930
We'll give a definition for an object and
a class, weâ€™ll talk about the concept of

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:16,080
encapsulation, we're talk about how to create
a class, enforcing protections and access,

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,580
mechanisms for class accessors and mutators,
and we'll talk about the constant modifier.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,640
We're also going to talk about how to guarantee
that an object is created properly.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,510
We'll talk about using operators on classes
and we'll talk about classes that contain

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,990
dynamic memory.

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,870
We're also going to get into concepts of inheritance
and polymorphism.

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,550
And we'll talk about dynamic binding as well
as pure virtual functions.
