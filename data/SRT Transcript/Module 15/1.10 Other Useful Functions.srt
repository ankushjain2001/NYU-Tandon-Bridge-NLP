1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,610
So now that we've got data that we can store
inside the function inside the object and

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,410
we can get data out of the object, then perhaps
we should have some other useful functions.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,860
It's really common here in the U.S. that we
might print a date in the term, in the form

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,250
of day slash month slash year.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,600
So we could add a function inside our object
inside our class where we can display the

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,700
date in the form of day slash month slash
year.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,980
So you can take a look at the code for that;
it would be a very simple function to write.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,920
Again it's const-ified because it's not changing
any of the data.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,980
We might also write a function to validate,
to check to see if the date is valid, and

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,210
it will return true or false.

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,110
For example, if somebody puts in February
thirty first of two thousand and sixteen,

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,890
that shouldn't be valid because there really
is no February thirty first; so that might

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,390
return false if we were to have a validate
function on that.

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,649
We could also check to make sure that the
leap year is valid and if we need a leap year

15
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,960
calculation; we need to check which years
are leap years and which years are not leap

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,790
years that may require another function.

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,840
And in that case the calculation of a leap
year may not be a function that we want to

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,389
have allowed access to from the outside, which
would make that function a private member

19
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:15,600
function.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,509
Really what I'm getting at here is the possibilities
are endless.

21
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,719
What you decide to do with a date class might
be very different from what somebody else

22
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,920
decides to do with a date class, but you can
do literally anything you want with it inside

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,400
C++.
