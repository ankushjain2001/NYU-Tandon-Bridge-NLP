1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,900
One of the problems that we're going to run
into is that if we just construct an object

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:11,120
like we did before and it's a Date object;
what are the values of day month in year immediately

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,090
after the construction of the Date object,
they’re garbage, they’re garbage values.

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,630
We don't know what their values are and they
may not even be valid so it's very possible

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,890
that we may have a large number for the day,
like negative eight hundred thousand and it's

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,300
now here are stored inside, what we would
classify as an acceptable date object, because

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,780
we created it.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,290
So what C++ allows us to do is make sure that
we always know that valid values, even if

9
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,820
we just created that object, that there are
valid values in it.

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:53,110
So C++ creates thing called a constructor,
and we can create the constructor where it

11
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,850
runs code that we want so that we can set
the values appropriately for whatever the

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,850
default date is.

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,779
So the default constructor is a function which
is given a name which is exactly the same

14
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:10,460
and it is case sensitive, it’s exactly the
same as the name of the class.

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,420
There’s no return type, so it’s not void
or anything like that, it’s just literally

16
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,689
no return type, we don't list anything and
it doesn't have any parameters.

17
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:26,450
So we can see from the code that what we've
done here is create a constructor where we're

18
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,020
setting the values of day, month, and year,
to the appropriate to what we classify as

19
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,359
an appropriate value, without any interaction
by the user.

20
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,240
All the user has to do is create one of these
Date objects, by default, and it will set

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,599
those values to what we consider the default
values.
