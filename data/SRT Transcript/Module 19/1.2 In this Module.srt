1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,470
We've got a lot to cover in this module.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,310
We're going to talk about trees and binary
search trees.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,520
And we're going to start by talking about
the definition for trees and some of the definitions

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,470
of words that we use in conjunction with trees.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,320
We're going to talk about tree storage methods
and how we can take this model of what a tree

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,380
is and put it into main memory.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,000
We're going to talk about the design of binary
search trees and what they are, and how they

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,329
can help us.

9
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:27,920
We're going to talk about why we need binary
search trees and then we're going to talk

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,929
about tree traversals.

11
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,070
And what happens when a binary search tree
doesn't meet our requirements that we need

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,450
and then we're going to talk about balance
binary search trees including AVL trees, and

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,930
a little bit on red-black trees.

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,890
So we've got a lot to cover in this module;
stick with me.
