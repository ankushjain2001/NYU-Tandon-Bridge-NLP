I like this picture because it really shows
traffic inside a normal city environment.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,589
And what we have here is that each of the
cars that would enter the intersection sort

3
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:16,660
of went a little bit over and are now blocking
a portion of the intersection.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,940
And what you can see is that each car is waiting
for another car to move and the last car is

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,100
waiting for the first car to move, and ultimately
as you can tell, nothing is going to get done

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,100
here.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,460
There is no way that any of these cars are
going to move until someone decides to take

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,430
action, and just completely change the scenario;
maybe one of the cars could make a turn and

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,460
get out of there and then free up the intersection.

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,060
But ultimately what's happening is we are
controlling one quadrant of the intersection,

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:52,110
each car controls one quadrant of the intersection,
and needs one more quadrant in order to complete

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,370
its task of moving through the intersection
and we recognize that that can never occur.
