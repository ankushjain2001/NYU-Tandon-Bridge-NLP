1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,870
We talked about a lot during this module.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,810
We talked about what threads are; we gave
a little reminder about the threads.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,722
We talked about features of having multiple
threads accessing multiple resources and we

4
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:15,000
said that there was the possibility, of course,
that we could have asynchrony.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,780
And if we do have the possibility of a synchrony,
we said that we need to identify critical

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,770
sections so that we can protect those critical
sections using concurrency control mechanisms.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,170
And those concurrency control mechanisms that
we talked about are software and hardware

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,170
based.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,010
We talked about the idea of mutual exclusion
using semaphores.

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,679
We talked about the design of the semaphores,
and how they work internally we also went

11
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:43,469
into how deadlocks occur and how we can prevent
deadlocks. and then we talked about the dining

12
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,510
philosophers problem.

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,319
So, we really covered a lot during this module.
