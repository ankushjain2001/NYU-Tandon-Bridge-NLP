1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,570
We covered a lot of material in this module.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,570
We’ve looked at what is a linked list.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,740
We’ve looked at why do we need linked lists.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,679
We also talked about templates, and templates
are something that are going to keep coming

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,829
up time and time again throughout the rest
of the semester.

6
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:17,750
And in the data structures that we're going
to talk about because we never know what they

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,290
the type are storing inside of a data structure.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,260
We talked about the design of a linked list
and you should definitely take a look at the

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,000
code that we've posted in the CPP file for
this module associated with this, so take

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,529
a look at that because that is very useful
resource.

11
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:36,520
And then we talked about what linked lists
are used for and get some real world example.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,640
So going forward you should understand linked
lists and you should be able to make a judgment

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,170
call of whether you want to use an array or
vector or a linked list because that's going

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,930
to make a very big difference in terms of
your performance of your program.

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,190
And it's an important distinction that you
should understand.
