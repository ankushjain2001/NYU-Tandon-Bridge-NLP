00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,270
Before we get too deep into linked lists,
I have to talk to you about something else

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,910
that we need to go over first.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,940
C++ has this idea of templates and a lot of
languages have these now; they might call

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,310
them generics, they might call them templates.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,420
But the idea is that we don't really know
what data type we're going to be working with.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,360
So in C++ we can template; we can use a template
when we don't know what the data type is of

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,820
one or more elements.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,369
Before each function or class that we're going
to be working with, we have to put this indicator

9
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:35,390
this is a template class T. And T is just
my individual use, you can really use any

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,090
name but I just used to see all the time so
that's what I normally consider.

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,650
And that's a data type that we don't know
which data type it's actually going to be

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,650
in the end.

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:51,230
What C++ plus does is basically a find and
replace through that function to replace T

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,879
with the appropriate data type, whatever the
data type is.

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,850
So I've got here a function called my swap,
which is going to be a templated function

16
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,400
and it takes in two items and I don't know
what data type the items are.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,520
It could be two integers.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
It could be two doubles.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
It could be two floats.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
It could be two strings.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,830
It could be two elephants.

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,380
What it can't be is one int and one elephant,
so we can't mix and match data type.

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,700
T has to be T consistently whatever the data
type is.

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,740
So here we're going to swap two items, meaning
we're going to make the value that was in

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,500
A into B. And we're going to take the value
that was in B and store it in A, and the code

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,360
for that is overly simplistic; it's just three
copy operations.

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,500
But the real takeaway here is that you can
use any data type for this my swap function.

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,799
And in C++ you would just call my swap and
give it two integers or two elephants, it

29
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,000
would be fine with that and you don't need
to rewrite this function numerous times simply

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,659
to change the data type.

31
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,960
And that's a huge benefit when we get to working
with larger classes, particularly with storage

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,640
of items where we don't know what data type
is going to be stored in really we don't care

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,410
what data type is going to be store; our job
is to simply store the data type.

34
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,450
And I imagine this the way I tell my students
to envision this is, imagine if you're running

35
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:13,849
a storage company, like the big the big storage
companies here in New York where you can rent

36
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:14,909
out a room.

37
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,419
The company doesn't care what you put into
your room.

38
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:20,940
I guess they might care if it's going to be
dangerous but they don't care what you're

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,239
going to put into that room; they simply care
that you own the room.

40
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,980
And that's exactly what we're doing here.

41
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,040
We're saying we'd like to the ability to swap
two things and don't worry about what those

42
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,579
two things are.
