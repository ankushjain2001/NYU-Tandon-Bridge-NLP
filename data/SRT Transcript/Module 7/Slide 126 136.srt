0:00:00.520,0:00:05.080
One more note I want to add here when we analyze
the running time.

0:00:05.080,0:00:11.610
Now we as you can see we are not measuring
the running time using seconds as units.

0:00:11.610,0:00:14.879
We are using them as number of primitive operations
as units.

0:00:14.879,0:00:17.770
There this is what we are counting.

0:00:17.770,0:00:30.960
And we want to try to ignore the running time
based on the computer we are running it on.

0:00:30.960,0:00:37.040
So we want to ignore the hardware technology
that the algorithm is ran on.

0:00:37.040,0:00:45.090
Obviously if we take the a computer twice
as fast our algorithm would run twice as fast.

0:00:45.090,0:00:52.100
And we want to as I said before we want to
make some kind of quality kind of a criteria

0:00:52.100,0:00:56.320
that separates the algorithm by their quality.

0:00:56.320,0:01:04.000
And for that we would try to avoid and to
move aside the hardware technology.

0:01:04.000,0:01:10.049
In order to do that we make what is called
an asymptotic analysis that would look only

0:01:10.049,0:01:12.630
on the order of growth of T of N.

0:01:12.630,0:01:17.429
Not at the number of primitive operations
but the number of growth of the number of

0:01:17.429,0:01:18.979
primitive operations.

0:01:18.979,0:01:23.560
So if informally we said that we compare the
number of primitive operations executed by

0:01:23.560,0:01:26.759
the process of the function of the input size.

0:01:26.759,0:01:35.289
Using the asymptotic analysis we compare the
asymptotic order of the number of primitive

0:01:35.289,0:01:39.290
operations executed by the process of the
function of the input size.

0:01:39.290,0:01:42.299
Obviously you don’t know what are the asymptotic
order.

0:01:42.299,0:01:49.979
Basically means I will talk about it in a
much more formal way in a few minutes but

0:01:49.979,0:01:52.329
first let me give you as a rule of thumb.

0:01:52.329,0:01:57.020
T of N is three N squared plus six N minus
fifteen.

0:01:57.020,0:02:03.119
In order to get the asymptotic order of T
of N which is in this case theta of N squared.

0:02:03.119,0:02:10.910
We say asymptotic order is theta or sometimes
you will hear big O of N squared.

0:02:10.910,0:02:15.550
But for our conversation let’s use the term
theta.

0:02:15.550,0:02:20.780
In order to figure out the asymptotic order
of three N squared plus six N minus fifteen

0:02:20.780,0:02:24.780
is theta of N squared we will do two things.

0:02:24.780,0:02:30.200
We will drop lower order terms the six N minus
fifteen will be dropped off.

0:02:30.200,0:02:36.750
We will stick only with the high order term
in this case three N squared.

0:02:36.750,0:02:39.030
And we will also ignore the leading constant.

0:02:39.030,0:02:40.810
The three would be ignored.

0:02:40.810,0:02:44.340
So we will be left with N squared.

0:02:44.340,0:02:51.570
So we say that T of N is three N squared plus
six N minus fifteen but that is theta in asymptotic

0:02:51.570,0:02:53.010
order of N squared.
