0:00:00.570,0:00:06.130
Ok let’s take a look at another example
very similar to the previous one.

0:00:06.130,0:00:11.759
But implementation wise you can see that the
only difference is that the range we are iterating

0:00:11.759,0:00:16.049
in the inner loop is not one through N but
one through I.

0:00:16.049,0:00:18.160
Which is written in orange here.

0:00:18.160,0:00:27.369
So again we are reading N from the user and
then N times we are repeating a body of iterating

0:00:27.369,0:00:30.110
from one to I and breaking the line.

0:00:30.110,0:00:33.180
Printing I stars basically and breaking the
line.

0:00:33.180,0:00:38.070
So first iteration when I is one we are printing
one star and breaking the line.

0:00:38.070,0:00:42.640
Second iteration when I is two we are printing
two stars and breaking the line and then three

0:00:42.640,0:00:44.170
stars and breaking the line.

0:00:44.170,0:00:50.760
Altogether we will print this kind of a triangle
of stars.

0:00:50.760,0:00:57.690
Once again let’s try and analyze the running
time of this algorithm so our T of N here.

0:00:57.690,0:01:09.090
Now again I am ignoring the cout cin the return
zero at the end I am focusing on the major

0:01:09.090,0:01:15.220
part the major cost of our algorithm these
two nested loops.

0:01:15.220,0:01:23.420
Once again we are going to go from the inner
parts to the outer parts adding them all together.

0:01:23.420,0:01:29.800
In this case though we cannot say that each
iteration we are doing the same exact thing.

0:01:29.800,0:01:34.020
In the previous example each iteration we
printed the same amount of stars.

0:01:34.020,0:01:40.710
We did N operations each time so it was N
times N. In this case one time we are printing

0:01:40.710,0:01:43.580
one star then we are printing two stars and
three stars.

0:01:43.580,0:01:50.649
We can’t multiply something by N. The number
of operations we are doing here varies from

0:01:50.649,0:01:52.290
iteration to iteration.

0:01:52.290,0:01:58.270
We can say that each iteration we are doing
the theta of I operations right.

0:01:58.270,0:02:02.880
And then when we want to figure out what is
the total number of operations we are doing

0:02:02.880,0:02:06.110
here we are not multiplying I by something.

0:02:06.110,0:02:14.370
We would need to add these values over the
iterations the outer iterations we are doing

0:02:14.370,0:02:15.370
here.

0:02:15.370,0:02:20.150
So for I equals one we are doing one for I
equals two we are doing two for I equals three

0:02:20.150,0:02:25.270
we are doing three operations and so on up
to N. In order to figure out the total number

0:02:25.270,0:02:31.600
of operations here we would need to figure
out what is the order of growth what is the

0:02:31.600,0:02:37.030
asymptotic order of this sum here that goes
from one through N.

0:02:37.030,0:02:45.150
Now I guess you all know that arithmetic progression
the sum of this arithmetic progression adds

0:02:45.150,0:02:48.400
up to N times N plus one over two.

0:02:48.400,0:02:56.910
Which is basically half N squared plus half
N. And yea you can see that that is theta

0:02:56.910,0:02:59.890
of N squared right.

0:02:59.890,0:03:07.520
Again dropping the half N and dropping the
half as the constant we are left with N squared.

0:03:07.520,0:03:11.150
We can also formally prove by the definition
of theta.

0:03:11.150,0:03:17.300
But intuitively we can see that it is theta
of N squared.

0:03:17.300,0:03:22.870
Another way to view that is looking at the
image that we are basically printing this

0:03:22.870,0:03:24.970
triangle of stars here.

0:03:24.970,0:03:30.050
Now we can see that this triangle here is
half of the square right.

0:03:30.050,0:03:37.470
It is half N squared so again intuitively
N squared and half of N squared are only a

0:03:37.470,0:03:38.930
constant apart.

0:03:38.930,0:03:44.900
A factor constant apart and that would make
them both be the same order of growth.

0:03:44.900,0:03:47.140
The same squared order of growth.

0:03:47.140,0:03:53.050
So that’s a good thing to notice here.

0:03:53.050,0:03:59.250
Another important thing I want you to remember
memorize because we are going to use that

0:03:59.250,0:04:00.250
thing a lot.

0:04:00.250,0:04:06.390
And the visual image here of the triangle
that is basically half of the square really

0:04:06.390,0:04:14.490
demonstrates it that one plus two plus tree
plus four plus so on up to N is the same order

0:04:14.490,0:04:15.490
as N squared.

0:04:15.490,0:04:17.540
It is half of the square.

0:04:17.540,0:04:19.459
That’s the result we are going to use quite
a lot.
