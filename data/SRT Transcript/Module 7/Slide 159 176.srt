0:00:00.630,0:00:06.570
Ok let’s try to use the definition we just
saw the theta definition in order to show

0:00:06.570,0:00:12.490
that three N squared plus six N minus fifteen
is indeed theta of N squared.

0:00:12.490,0:00:18.210
Now this proposition here three N squared
plus six N minus fifteen is theta of N squared

0:00:18.210,0:00:23.539
is follows whatever the theta definition is
trying to define.

0:00:23.539,0:00:29.439
So it is of the form F of N is theta of G
of N. Or F of N here is three N squared plus

0:00:29.439,0:00:33.300
six N minutes fifteen and our G of N here
is N squared.

0:00:33.300,0:00:39.070
So it is of the form F of N is theta of G
of N. Let’s follow the definition the theta

0:00:39.070,0:00:42.650
definition in order to prove exactly that.

0:00:42.650,0:00:49.180
So by the definition in order for F to be
theta of G we need to show that there exists

0:00:49.180,0:00:59.310
three constants c1 c2 and n0 that for all
values greater or equal to n0 our F is in

0:00:59.310,0:01:03.560
between c1 and c2 as multiplicands of G.

0:01:03.560,0:01:13.240
So I don’t know what c1 c2 and n0 are now
but let’s first try to figure them out or

0:01:13.240,0:01:17.799
when we are proving we should first show them
and appoint to them.

0:01:17.799,0:01:22.689
And then we should show that they are good
enough constants.

0:01:22.689,0:01:28.280
So let’s assume we have these constants
and keep on with our proof.

0:01:28.280,0:01:35.380
So we need to show that for all N greater
or equal to n0 F of N is greater or equal

0:01:35.380,0:01:42.729
to one constant times G of N and less or equal
to another constant times G of N.

0:01:42.729,0:01:47.439
So let’s take a look at three N squared
plus six N minus fifteen.

0:01:47.439,0:01:53.119
Now three N squared plus six N minus fifteen
is obviously less or equal to three N squared

0:01:53.119,0:01:59.109
plus six N right we are just dropping off
the negative fifteen which makes the entire

0:01:59.109,0:02:04.679
expression here smaller or less than three
N squared plus six N without the negative

0:02:04.679,0:02:06.399
fifteen.

0:02:06.399,0:02:14.310
If we want to make three N squared plus six
N even greater instead of adding six N let’s

0:02:14.310,0:02:15.730
add six N squared.

0:02:15.730,0:02:22.810
So three N squared plus six N squared is obviously
even greater than three N squared plus six

0:02:22.810,0:02:26.990
N and that is greater than three N squared
plus six N minus fifteen.

0:02:26.990,0:02:35.480
So altogether we have that three N squared
minus six N minus fifteen is less or equal

0:02:35.480,0:02:37.280
to nine N squared.

0:02:37.280,0:02:47.980
That’s one multiplicand of G of N so our
c1 nine is a great choice for our c1 right.

0:02:47.980,0:02:51.470
Now let’s try to find c2.

0:02:51.470,0:02:56.490
So let’s take a look back at three N squared
plus six N minus fifteen.

0:02:56.490,0:03:01.350
Now I can say that three N squared plus six
N minus fifteen is greater or equal to three

0:03:01.350,0:03:04.510
N squared dropping off the six N minutes fifteen.

0:03:04.510,0:03:11.280
But that would be true only if six N minutes
fifteen is a positive value otherwise we can’t

0:03:11.280,0:03:12.280
just drop it.

0:03:12.280,0:03:14.340
If it is a negative value it would make it
smaller right.

0:03:14.340,0:03:21.070
So let’s see when is six N minus fifteen
greater or equal to zero.

0:03:21.070,0:03:26.770
So six N minus fifteen is greater or equal
to zero if and only six N is greater or equal

0:03:26.770,0:03:31.980
to fifteen or in other words N is greater
or equal to 2.5.

0:03:31.980,0:03:37.900
So we can’t say that always three N plus
six N minus fifteen is greater or equal to

0:03:37.900,0:03:39.160
three N squared.

0:03:39.160,0:03:43.580
But for values greater or equal to 2.5 that
would be true.

0:03:43.580,0:03:50.590
So let’s take our starting position to be
three let’s take our n0 to be three.

0:03:50.590,0:03:56.569
And for values greater or equal to three we
can safely say that three N squared plus six

0:03:56.569,0:03:59.560
N minus fifteen is greater or equal to three
N squared.

0:03:59.560,0:04:04.140
So c2 can then be three.

0:04:04.140,0:04:09.400
Altogether we can say that starting at three
now we have that three N squared plus six

0:04:09.400,0:04:16.329
N minus fifteen is less or equal to nine squared
and it is greater or equal to three N squared.

0:04:16.329,0:04:23.940
So we have two multiplicands of N squared
that bound this our F of N.

0:04:23.940,0:04:29.600
So by definition we can conclude that three
N squared plus six N minus fifteen is theta

0:04:29.600,0:04:30.830
of N squared.

0:04:30.830,0:04:36.830
Now when we made this proof we didn’t know
in the beginning what are c1 c2 n0 are going

0:04:36.830,0:04:37.830
to be.

0:04:37.830,0:04:44.370
We figured them out during our process of
proving.

0:04:44.370,0:04:51.139
After we have done that let’s try now to
read it over and make sure that our proof

0:04:51.139,0:04:52.370
works correctly.

0:04:52.370,0:05:02.139
So in order to show that our F of N is theta
of G of N we take c1 to be 9 c2 to be 3 and

0:05:02.139,0:05:04.160
n0 to be 3.

0:05:04.160,0:05:11.560
Then for all values for all Ns greater or
equal to three we have that three N squared

0:05:11.560,0:05:18.820
plus six N minus fifteen is less or equal
to nine N squared and it is greater or equal

0:05:18.820,0:05:23.050
to three N squared therefore it is theta of
N squared.

0:05:23.050,0:05:31.980
So now it makes sense as we read it that we
really showed that there are three such constants

0:05:31.980,0:05:41.570
that have what we one of them to have to bound
F of N by these two multiplicands of G.
