0:00:00.789,0:00:05.980
Ok so we said that when we are analyzing a
runtime of an algorithm basically we compare

0:00:05.980,0:00:13.330
the asymptotic order of the number of primitive
operations as a function of the input size.

0:00:13.330,0:00:22.340
So if T of N that represents the number of
primitive operations is three N squared plus

0:00:22.340,0:00:24.410
six N minus fifteen.

0:00:24.410,0:00:29.640
In order to figure out the asymptotic order
of it as a rule of thumb we said we are dropping

0:00:29.640,0:00:35.450
lower terms and we are ignoring the constants
and that would give us theta of N squared.

0:00:35.450,0:00:42.390
Let’s make the asymptotic order the definition
of theta a bit more formal.

0:00:42.390,0:00:45.530
So it goes something like that.

0:00:45.530,0:00:51.350
Assuming we have two functions F of N and
G of N that basically represents running time

0:00:51.350,0:00:58.060
means it goes from positive integers to positive
real numbers.

0:00:58.060,0:01:09.350
We say that F of N is theta of G of N if there
exists two real constants c1 and c2 and another

0:01:09.350,0:01:13.530
positive integer constant named n0.

0:01:13.530,0:01:22.630
Where for all N greater or equal to n0 F of
N is bounded in between two multiplicands

0:01:22.630,0:01:31.159
of G of N it is bounded in c1 G of N and c2
G of N. And that should be for all N greater

0:01:31.159,0:01:33.240
or equal to n0.

0:01:33.240,0:01:41.120
Now you should take a very close look at this
definition let’s try to look at it visually.

0:01:41.120,0:01:46.170
So for example if you have F of N that is
the function we are trying to figure out the

0:01:46.170,0:01:47.260
order of right.

0:01:47.260,0:01:50.650
We are trying to say F of N is theta of G
of N.

0:01:50.650,0:01:58.060
So assuming you have a function F of N and
assuming you look at two multiplicands of

0:01:58.060,0:02:03.720
G of N. One of them is four times G of N this
green line here the other is a third times

0:02:03.720,0:02:08.700
G of N this kind of blue line here.

0:02:08.700,0:02:12.159
And let’s look at this point here eight.

0:02:12.159,0:02:20.719
And you can see that when you look over eight
all the values of F the black line here is

0:02:20.719,0:02:23.740
in between these two multiplicands of G.

0:02:23.740,0:02:28.159
In between four times G and a third times
G.

0:02:28.159,0:02:36.549
So you have three constants here you have
n0 as eight that’s the position from where

0:02:36.549,0:02:39.879
it is all this inequality here is true.

0:02:39.879,0:02:47.439
So starting at zero F of N is less or equal
to four times G of N and it is greater or

0:02:47.439,0:02:50.150
equal to a third times G of N.

0:02:50.150,0:02:54.459
So our c1 would be four and our c2 would be
a third.

0:02:54.459,0:03:02.870
So we have these three constants two multiplicands
of G that bound F of N starting at a specific

0:03:02.870,0:03:05.450
point in this case at eight.

0:03:05.450,0:03:12.290
Therefore we can say that F of N is theta
of G of N that is what this definition is

0:03:12.290,0:03:13.540
trying to say.

0:03:13.540,0:03:21.329
In order to argue that F is theta of G you
should show that starting at this specific

0:03:21.329,0:03:27.329
point starting at n0 F of N is in between
two multiplicands of G.

0:03:27.329,0:03:34.330
And you have to show these two or you have
to give these two multiplicands these c1 and

0:03:34.330,0:03:34.830
c2.
