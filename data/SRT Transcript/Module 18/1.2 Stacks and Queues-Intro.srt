00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,590
In this module we're going to talk about a
couple of data structures the two data structures

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,580
that we're going to talk about our stacks
and queues.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,440
And these really popular data structures in
computer science and we use them over and

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,940
over and over again.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,850
So we're going to talk about first the stack
we are going to explain what it is and how

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,500
it works and what it's designed for and then
I'm going to talk about some uses that we

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,830
could apply the stack to and then we're going
to talk about queues.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,330
We're going to talk about the same thing what
it is and how it works and what it's designed

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,140
for and then what we use queues for.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,949
So coming away from this you're going to have
a good look at two very fundamental data structures

11
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:39,660
in computer science and you should understand
both how they are built and how they are used.
