1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,759
So now that we understand how a queue is built,
what do we use it for?

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,990
The fundamental way that we use queues as
storage buffer, so there's going to be a lot

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,320
of situations where we're bringing information
in.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,660
For example you've already worked with the
IO stream and, whether we're talking about

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,800
a file stream or whether we're talking about
keyboard input, we are talking about bringing

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,999
in a large amount of data at first, storing
it temporarily, and then slowly feeding it

7
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:31,169
into your user program.

8
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:36,120
So in the case of reading a file, because
it's an expensive endeavor to actually read

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,360
data from the secondary storage device, what
we're instead going to do is grab a large

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,240
portion of the file, perhaps all of it, store
it temporarily in a structure in main memory,

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,240
and then as the program asks for it it's going
to be fed in slowly.

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,520
Now the best structure for that of course
is a first in first out buffer, or a queue.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,180
So there's one situation is as there.

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,670
We might use it in operating systems, later
we're going to talk about memory management,

15
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,890
and we're going to talk about removing the
oldest page of main memory for example.

16
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,560
And how do we know which one is the oldest?

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,500
Well we keep a FIFO list, a FIFO queue, of
all the pages that are in main memory and

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,390
when we need to throw one away we throw away
the front of the queue, so there's options

19
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,890
for that.

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,729
Really anywhere in computer science where
we need in an ordered list; where we have

21
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:29,950
first in first out property.

22
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,229
That's where we're going to use a queue.

23
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,280
So there's a lot of situations that you're
going to see throughout your career in computer

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,119
science that you're going to use a queue and
they are a very popular structure.
