0:00:00.680,0:00:08.280
Ok let’s then try to use this while statements
this iterative capability that we just talked

0:00:08.280,0:00:12.480
about in order to solve our counting program.

0:00:12.480,0:00:22.039
Let’s try and think how we can use the capability
of repeating some statements over and over

0:00:22.039,0:00:27.110
in order to print numbers let’s say from
1 to N.

0:00:27.110,0:00:37.040
So we can maybe maintain some kind of a variable
a counter that would be initialized to one

0:00:37.040,0:00:39.590
printed and incremented.

0:00:39.590,0:00:40.730
Printed and incremented.

0:00:40.730,0:00:47.530
Something like that we will start counter
as one and we will print one and increment

0:00:47.530,0:00:48.530
counter to two.

0:00:48.530,0:00:51.500
We will print two and we will increment counter
to three.

0:00:51.500,0:00:53.920
Will print three and increment counter to
four.

0:00:53.920,0:00:59.660
So basically we are repeating two statements
here print the value of counter and increment

0:00:59.660,0:01:00.660
it.

0:01:00.660,0:01:01.809
Print the value of counter and increment it.

0:01:01.809,0:01:09.460
If we do it a right amount of times we will
basically print numbers from 1 to wherever

0:01:09.460,0:01:10.960
we decide to go.

0:01:10.960,0:01:14.040
Let’s implement it using C code now.
