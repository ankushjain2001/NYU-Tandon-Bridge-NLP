Ok so the syntax of the while statement goes
like this.

0:00:04.760,0:00:12.929
So you have a few statements then comes the
while keyword and then enclosed in parentheses

0:00:12.929,0:00:16.000
you have a condition.

0:00:16.000,0:00:25.910
And as a compound statement you can have a
body of statements that are tabbed one tab

0:00:25.910,0:00:27.130
to the right.

0:00:27.130,0:00:33.899
After the while you have your program just
continues at the original alignment.

0:00:33.899,0:00:38.170
But that’s basically the syntax of a while
expression.

0:00:38.170,0:00:43.680
Let’s talk about the semantics how a while
expression is basically a while statement

0:00:43.680,0:00:46.820
is basically executed.

0:00:46.820,0:00:51.199
So the program is executed up to the while
statement.

0:00:51.199,0:00:57.629
When it reaches the while statement the first
thing that happens is that condition is evaluated

0:00:57.629,0:01:01.280
and then actually there are two cases.

0:01:01.280,0:01:03.070
Either it is true or false.

0:01:03.070,0:01:10.110
If the condition is true the body is executed
and the condition is reevaluated.

0:01:10.110,0:01:13.060
Again two options either true or false.

0:01:13.060,0:01:18.390
If it is true body is executed condition evaluated
once more.

0:01:18.390,0:01:20.890
True body condition.

0:01:20.890,0:01:23.259
True body condition evaluated.

0:01:23.259,0:01:30.719
When the condition turns false the program
just continues in its original path.

0:01:30.719,0:01:36.729
So basically while the condition is still
true the body is executed over and over and

0:01:36.729,0:01:37.729
over.

0:01:37.729,0:01:38.890
That’s why it is called the while statement.

0:01:38.890,0:01:43.869
While the condition is true we keep repeating
the execution of the body over and over.

0:01:43.869,0:01:49.899
When the condition turns false we break out
and continue with the flow of our program.

0:01:49.899,0:01:54.780
So that’s basically the semantics of a while
statement.

0:01:54.780,0:01:59.280
This is syntactically the extended version
of a while.

0:01:59.280,0:02:06.310
The simpler version just as we had with the
Ifs doesn’t require a compound statement.

0:02:06.310,0:02:13.099
You can have a single statement body then
you don’t need the curly braces to enclose

0:02:13.099,0:02:14.610
this statement in it.
