We’ve talked about for loops while loops
iterative statements.

0:00:05.859,0:00:08.540
Let’s look at another problem now.

0:00:08.540,0:00:13.540
Let’s talk about how to compute the average
of a collection of numbers.

0:00:13.540,0:00:21.110
For example let’s assume the user enters
a sequence of grades and calculates and prints

0:00:21.110,0:00:24.340
the average of the sequence.

0:00:24.340,0:00:28.910
Let’s try to aim for a behavior that looks
something like that.

0:00:28.910,0:00:35.050
At first the program would ask the user please
enter the number of students you have in the

0:00:35.050,0:00:36.050
class.

0:00:36.050,0:00:44.420
The user can say let’s say 4 and then the
program would ask the user please enter the

0:00:44.420,0:00:47.760
students’ grades separated by spaces.

0:00:47.760,0:00:55.170
The user would then enter four grades for
example 71 86 68 94.

0:00:55.170,0:01:01.379
And eventually the program would respond by
saying what’s the average of this sequence.

0:01:01.379,0:01:06.520
In this case the class average is 79.75.

0:01:06.520,0:01:13.820
So in order to implement this problem here
we need to calculate an average.

0:01:13.820,0:01:18.890
And in order to calculate the average basically
you need to sum up all the numbers and divide

0:01:18.890,0:01:20.970
it by the amount of numbers.

0:01:20.970,0:01:23.030
That would give you the average.

0:01:23.030,0:01:29.159
So to do that we know how many numbers are
going to be that’s the first input we got

0:01:29.159,0:01:30.189
from the user.

0:01:30.189,0:01:35.020
The number of students in the class but in
order to figure out the sum of the numbers

0:01:35.020,0:01:41.280
the sum of the grades we would need to accumulate
them in some kind of sum variable.

0:01:41.280,0:01:47.360
Just as we did in the calculating the sum
of the digits of a number.

0:01:47.360,0:01:51.420
So basically we are going to repeat here two
things over and over.

0:01:51.420,0:01:54.400
We will read an input and add it to sum.

0:01:54.400,0:01:55.990
Read an input and add it to sum.

0:01:55.990,0:01:57.759
Read an input and add it to sum.

0:01:57.759,0:02:00.700
Over and over for each grade the user enters.

0:02:00.700,0:02:06.950
After we will finish up reading and accumulating
the sum we will have a variable containing

0:02:06.950,0:02:11.829
the total sum which we can then divide by
the amount of numbers to figure out what the

0:02:11.829,0:02:13.079
average is.

0:02:13.079,0:02:16.099
Let’s get into the details of this implementation.
