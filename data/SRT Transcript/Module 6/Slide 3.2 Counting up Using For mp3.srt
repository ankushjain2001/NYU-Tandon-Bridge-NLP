0:00:00.049,0:00:05.040
Ok then let’s try to count up now using
the for loop.

0:00:05.040,0:00:12.040
So once again let’s first ask the user to
please enter a positive integer let’s read

0:00:12.040,0:00:20.029
this input so we declared an n and read into
that n and now we’re supposed to start counting

0:00:20.029,0:00:21.220
from one to n.

0:00:21.220,0:00:27.390
Once again we’ll create this counter variable
but now that we have a for loop as we said

0:00:27.390,0:00:34.470
there are three parts of this for statement
there is the initialization the condition

0:00:34.470,0:00:36.219
and the increment.

0:00:36.219,0:00:43.280
So we can initialize counter to one we want
to keep repeating as long as counter is less

0:00:43.280,0:00:45.449
or equal to four.

0:00:45.449,0:00:52.230
And then we want to repeat two things we want
to print the value of counter and we want

0:00:52.230,0:00:54.030
to increment counter.

0:00:54.030,0:01:02.609
Instead of incrementing counter here inside
the for loop we can increment it in the increment

0:01:02.609,0:01:05.790
position so counter plus plus goes over here.

0:01:05.790,0:01:11.860
Let’s try to trace this execution so once
again we have our two variables n and counter.

0:01:11.860,0:01:14.890
Let’s assume the user enters four for n.

0:01:14.890,0:01:21.840
And first we initialize counter to one we
check whether the Boolean condition is true

0:01:21.840,0:01:24.850
or false if counter is less than four in this
case it is.

0:01:24.850,0:01:28.770
So we are printing one the value of counter.

0:01:28.770,0:01:35.840
And after executing the body we execute the
increment statement basically increasing counter

0:01:35.840,0:01:36.840
to two.

0:01:36.840,0:01:43.790
We then check whether the Boolean expression
is still true it is so we print value of counter

0:01:43.790,0:01:46.250
and we increment counter to three.

0:01:46.250,0:01:53.710
The Boolean condition is still true so we
print the value of counter and increment counter

0:01:53.710,0:01:55.520
basically turning it to four.

0:01:55.520,0:02:00.750
The Boolean expression is still true so we
are printing the value of counter printing

0:02:00.750,0:02:06.310
four and incrementing the value of counter
basically incrementing it to five.

0:02:06.310,0:02:11.570
Now the Boolean condition is false we are
breaking out of the for loop we can once again

0:02:11.570,0:02:13.159
return zero and end this execution.
