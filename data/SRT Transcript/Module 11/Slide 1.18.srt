So we covered a lot of material in this module
we covered pointers and we covered how to

0:00:05.340,0:00:10.420
make a pointer point to something how to get
the address of a variable how to access information

0:00:10.420,0:00:12.110
via a pointer.

0:00:12.110,0:00:16.570
We also talked about heap dynamic variables
and heap dynamic arrays.

0:00:16.570,0:00:21.640
We talked about vectors and we talked about
the range for loops we covered a lot of material

0:00:21.640,0:00:27.790
and this does take quite a bit of time to
acclimate to using heap dynamic variables

0:00:27.790,0:00:31.440
and making sure that we don't have memory
leaks and making sure that we don't have double

0:00:31.440,0:00:32.440
deletes.

0:00:32.440,0:00:36.219
But we'll get used to them over the course
of the semester and you'll be experts by the

0:00:36.219,0:00:36.719
end.
