So what can we do with heap dynamic arrays?

0:00:03.040,0:00:06.830
Thankfully everything that we can do with
normal arrays.

0:00:06.830,0:00:12.260
All the normal arrays we've been working with
are actually just pointers to stack dynamic

0:00:12.260,0:00:13.260
arrays.

0:00:13.260,0:00:18.660
So even when we created those old stack dynamic
arrays that you did in previous modules you

0:00:18.660,0:00:23.779
actually had a pointer to the base of a stack
dynamic array.

0:00:23.779,0:00:29.050
Well now we have the pointer to the base of
a heap dynamic array and we can do everything

0:00:29.050,0:00:31.929
that we could do with the old stack dynamic
arrays.

0:00:31.929,0:00:37.680
There's really no difference heap dynamic
arrays work just the same way as stack dynamic

0:00:37.680,0:00:38.680
arrays.

0:00:38.680,0:00:42.890
We can still use the square brackets operators
to access each of the individual elements.

0:00:42.890,0:00:48.250
We also now if we wanted to could use the
star operator dereference operator to access

0:00:48.250,0:00:49.960
just the first element.

0:00:49.960,0:00:54.270
So we see that there's really no difference
between a heap dynamic array and a stack dynamic

0:00:54.270,0:00:54.770
array.
